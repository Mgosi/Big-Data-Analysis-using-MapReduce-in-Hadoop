But his imitators rarely come up with movies as pointless as “Naples in Veils,” which tips its hat vigorously toward the master’s motifs — the lost-and-found doubling of “Vertigo,” the repressed trauma of “Marnie,” possibly even Salvador Dalí’s eye design from “Spellbound” — only to wind up as a tedious muddle.Adriana (Giovanna Mezzogiorno), a pathologist in Naples who is shy with men, has a one-night stand with Andrea (Alessandro Borghi), a much younger diver. The sex is rendered with a level of detail that seems more suited to a Euro-art remake of “Fifty Shades of Grey” than a Hitchcock riff — but then again, it’s supposed to become an obsession for Adriana. They make plans to meet at a museum the next day, except Andrea doesn’t show up.Or rather, he has shown up dead in a nearby dumpster, something Adriana learns soon after starting an autopsy on his corpse. But then she spots him, alive, in a subway station. And in her garden. And did we mention that her mother apparently went crazy?Promising ideas are in place; even using as a backdrop a city as rich in history and steeped in Catholicism as Naples might have appealed to Hitch. But the director, Ferzan Ozpetek, hasn’t found a way to bring his borrowed themes together with style, momentum or suspense. Visually and musically, “Naples in Veils” does little to conjure a sensation of passion or delirium. All that’s left, in this case, is a self-nullifying plot.When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Movie data powered by IMDb.comNot rated.
