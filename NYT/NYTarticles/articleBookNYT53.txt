Others on the list announced Monday included Angie Thomas' best-seller about a teen girl whose friend is shot by police, "The Hate U Give," and Dav Pilkey's "Captain Underpants" series.The list is part of the association's "State of America's Libraries Report" and was released at the start of National Library Week.Advertisement
