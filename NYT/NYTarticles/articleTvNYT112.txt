Come back every Friday for new suggestions on what to watch.‘Matt Baume’s Culture Cruise’ When to watch: Now, on YouTube.This thoughtful and thorough web series from Matt Baume takes a closer look at queer representation — the good and the bad — in pop culture. He explains common story elements that popped up, for example, on “Golden Girls” or “Rhoda,” and he traces not only how stories about queer characters have changed but also how TV has changed in general. The episodes are short, informative and funny, but not lecutre-y.‘High Maintenance’ When to watch: Sunday at 10:30 p.m., on HBO.The wistful, often hilarious, always tender weed-delivery comedy “High Maintenance” is back for a new season. The Guy (Ben Sinclair) is living the dream, splitting his time between Brooklyn and upstate New York. But even in a more bucolic setting, it turns out everyone has the same quiet loneliness and sense of unwanted detachment, and they, too, treat it by getting stoned. The show looks at all of its characters with so much compassion, it is almost overwhelming in its intimacy.‘The Art Detectives’ When to watch: Now, on Acorn TV.If you like your shows deliberate and educational, try this gently paced British documentary series that goes in hard on art history and sometimes restoration. According to the show, 80 percent of Britain’s publicly owned art is in storage or archives, just waiting for an excitable nerd to give it the attention it deserves. The art historian Bendor Grosvenor and, in Seasons 2 and 3, the social historian Emma Dabiri explain the specifics of a given painting — the brush strokes, the style, the materials — and also the general context from which the work emerged.Advertisement
