They teach us how to be good or very, very bad. They teach us how to smile and flirt, fight and surrender. They teach how to be a man, how to be a woman.Movies are a space for dreams and for fantasies, including those that sometimes make us uneasy, squirm or rage. If you are a woman, you probably have wondered whose dreams are these, anyway? From “Snow White” to “Gone With the Wind,” films have taught us that women are to be kissed, at times even violently. Other movies, from “Halloween” to “Gravity,” have taught us that women can take care of themselves. They fight and survive. (And sometimes get a hit sequel, too.)We would like to hear from women about what movie made the biggest impression on them, good or bad. Your answers may be included in an article.Advertisement
