Anderszewski is something of a specialist in Beethoven’s Diabelli Variations: He has been associated with it at least since his brilliant release on Virgin Classics in 2001. Here the eccentric pianist prefaces the Beethoven with preludes and fugues from the second book of Bach’s “The Well-Tempered Clavier.” 212-721-6500, lincolncenter.orgCHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER at Alice Tully Hall (March 31, 5 p.m.). One of the Chamber Music Society’s more enticing programs this season pairs a Bach cantata, “Ich habe genug,” with Haydn’s “The Seven Last Words of Our Savior on the Cross.” The Orion String Quartet performs the Haydn and is joined by the oboist Stephen Taylor, the bassist Timothy Cobb, the harpsichordist Paolo Bordignon and the bass-baritone Ryan Speedo Green for the Bach. 212-875-5788, chambermusicsociety.orgCHOIR OF KING’S COLLEGE, CAMBRIDGE, at St. Thomas Church (April 1, 7:30 p.m.). There is a symbolic passing of the baton here, or at least of the vestments. Stephen Cleobury has been the director of music at King’s College, with its famed boy choristers, since 1982. On this, his final tour before retirement in the fall, he and his choir stop at St. Thomas, where his successor, Daniel Hyde, is currently director of music. The program sprawls, from Monteverdi, Tallis and Byrd to Britten, Howells and Vaughan Williams. 212-757-7013, saintthomaschurch.org‘LA CLEMENZA DI TITO’ at the Metropolitan Opera (March 30, 8:30 p.m.; April 3, 8 p.m.; through April 20). Jean-Pierre Ponnelle’s production returns, and with it comes the prospect of Joyce DiDonato singing the role of Sesto. Joining her are Matthew Polenzani as Tito, Ying Fang as Servilia, Elza van den Heever as Vitellia, Christian Van Horn as Publio and Emily D’Angelo as Annio. Lothar Koenigs conducts. 212-362-6000, metopera.org‘DIARY OF ONE WHO DISAPPEARED’ at BAM Howard Gilman Opera House (April 4-6, 7:30 p.m.). In association with the Flemish opera company Muziektheater Transparant, the inimitable Ivo van Hove directs a much-anticipated staging of Janacek’s raw song cycle, with added music by Annelies Van Parys. Singers include Andrew Dickinson and Marie Hamard. 718-636-4100, bam.org[Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.]REBECCA FISCHER at Miller Theater (April 2, 6 p.m.). Formerly the first violinist of the Chiara String Quartet, Fischer performs a free pop-up concert of seven works by female composers, including Gabriela Lena Frank, Lisa Bielawa, Paola Prestini, Jessie Montgomery, Shih-Hui Chen, Missy Mazzoli and Suzanne Farrin. 212-854-7799, millertheatre.comMITSUKO UCHIDA at Carnegie Hall (March 29, 8 p.m.). If there is a finer Mozart pianist alive than Uchida, I have yet to hear one. Her most recent, self-recommending recordings of selected piano concertos on Decca saw her leading the Cleveland Orchestra from the keyboard. Here she directs the Mahler Chamber Orchestra in Piano Concertos Nos. 19 and 20. In between, the orchestra plays three pieces from Berg’s “Lyric Suite.” 212-247-7800, carnegiehall.orgAdvertisement
