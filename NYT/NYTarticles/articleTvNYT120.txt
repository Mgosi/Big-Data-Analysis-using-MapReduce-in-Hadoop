By turns uproarious, rowdy, and lush. A gobsmacking marvel of choreography and musical direction.”[Read the full review of Beyoncé’s Coachella set.]Beyoncé had been scheduled to headline the festival in 2017, but pushed her performance back a year after becoming pregnant with twins. “Thank you for allowing me to be the first black woman to headline Coachella,” she told the crowd at her comeback show.The trailer for “Homecoming” features clips from rehearsals and Beyoncé’s workout routine, in addition to moments with her children and husband, the rapper Jay-Z, who made a cameo appearance at Coachella. Using a 2013 interview with the poet and activist Maya Angelou, not long before her death the next year, a voice-over on the trailer says, “What I really wanted to do is be a representative of my race — of the human race.”“I have a chance to show how kind we can be, how intelligent and generous we can be,” Angelou continues. “I have a chance to teach and to love and to laugh. And I know that when I finish doing what I’m sent here to do, I will be called home.”Advertisement
