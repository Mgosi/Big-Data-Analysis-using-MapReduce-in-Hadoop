Poroshenko said that date would conflict with the obligation to hold a debate at the studios of the national television channel.Both did take drug tests, though at different locations, which reportedly came back clean.Several thousand people stood outside the stadium in Kiev listening to the statement Poroshenko gave inside and the president's answers to journalist questions.Poroshenko once again belittled his election opponent's lack of political experience and alleged the comedian's reliance on social media rather than direct voter contact made him an unknown quantity."The Ukrainian people should not choose a virtual candidate," he said."When a candidate flashes on the screens, but says nothing, for the majority it's just a plot from ... 'Servant of the People'," he said, referring to the television series in which Zelenskiy plays a teacher who unexpectedly becomes president after a video of him ranting about corruption goes viral."I have to say these words - the fate of Ukraine is in danger," Poroshenko said.Poroshenko also challenged Zelenskiy to take part in a televised debate on Monday. There was no immediate response from Zelenskiy's campaign staff.___Jim Heintz in Moscow contributed to this story.Advertisement
