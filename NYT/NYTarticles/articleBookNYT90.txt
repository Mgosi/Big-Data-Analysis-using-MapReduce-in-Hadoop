In 1973, Margaret Atwood reviewed Rich’s collection “Diving Into the Wreck” for the Book Review.This is Adrienne Rich’s seventh book of poems, and it is an extraordinary one. When I first heard the author read from it, I felt as though the top of my head was being attacked, sometimes with an ice pick, sometimes with a blunter instrument: a hatchet or a hammer. The predominant emotions seemed to be anger and hatred, and these are certainly present; but when I read the poems later, they evoked a far more subtle reaction. “Diving Into the Wreck” is one of those rare books that forces you to decide not just what you think about it; but what you think about yourself.The wreck she is diving into, in the very strong title poem, is the wreck of obsolete myths, particularly myths about men and women. She is journeying to something that is already in the past, in order to discover for herself the reality behind the myth, “the wreck and not the story of the wreck / the thing itself and not the myth.” What she finds is part treasure and part corpse, and she also finds that she herself is part of it, a “half-destroyed instrument.”This quest — the quest for something beyond myths, for the truths about men and women, about the I and the You, the He and the She, or more generally (in the references to wars and persecutions of various kinds) about the powerless and the powerful — is presented throughout the book through a clear style and through metaphors which become their own myths. At their most successful the poems move like dreams, simultaneously revealing and alluding, disguising and concealing. The truth, it seems, is not just what you find when you open a door: it is itself a door, which the poet is always on the verge of going through.Follow New York Times Books on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, sign up for our newsletter or our literary calendar.
