Wherever this group goes, you should follow, and in this case it’s to the music of Wolfgang Mitterer. Brad Lubman, the ensemble’s music director, speaks to Mitterer in an onstage discussion before a performance of “Im Sturm,” a song cycle for baritone (Jeffrey Gavett), prepared piano (Red Wierenga) and electronics (Paul Coleman). A second concert, free at St. Peter’s Church on Nov. 30, includes the composer playing a solo organ and electronics set.212-319-5300, acfny.org‘GLASS HANDEL’ at the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine (Nov. 26-27, 7 and 9:30 p.m.). Part art installation, part fashion show, part video screening, part ballet and, oh, part vocal recital, the countertenor Anthony Roth Costanzo’s innovative approach to staging music by Handel and Philip Glass is produced by National Sawdust and Opera Philadelphia, and includes Eric Jacobsen conducting the Knights. The most exciting seats — pushed around during the concert to change a listener’s perspective — are sold out, but others are still available.646-779-8455, nationalsawdust.org‘IL TRITTICO’ at the Metropolitan Opera (Nov. 23 and 26, 7:30 p.m., through Dec. 15). Puccini’s trilogy returns to the house where it had its premiere 100 years ago next month. Marcelo Álvarez and Amber Wagner star in “Il Tabarro,” Kristine Opolais is the heroine in “Suor Angelica,” and Plácido Domingo sings the title role in “Gianni Schicchi.” Bertrand de Billy conducts Jack O’Brien’s traditional production, which made its debut in 2007.212-362-6000, metopera.org‘LA BOHÈME’ at the Metropolitan Opera (Nov. 29, 7:30 p.m., through Dec. 13). James Gaffigan, a native New Yorker, drew strong reviews for his conducting when the Met mounted Franco Zeffirelli’s picture-perfect production of Puccini’s classic earlier in the season. Now he returns with a second cast that features Ailyn Pérez as Mimì, Michael Fabiano as Rodolfo and Angel Blue as Musetta.212-362-6000, metopera.orgNEW YORK PHILHARMONIC at David Geffen Hall (Nov. 29, 7:30 p.m., through Dec. 4). The music of two unlikely friends is joined in this program, conducted by Jaap van Zweden: Dmitri Shostakovich, represented by his titanic “Leningrad” Symphony, and Benjamin Britten, with his Violin Concerto. Simone Lamsma is the soloist.212-875-5656, nyphil.orgCHRIS THILE at Weill Recital Hall (Nov. 28, 6:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Thile is this year’s composer’s chair at Carnegie Hall, and he opens his tenure on mandolin and vocals with this pair of concerts, featuring a premiere of his own music and selections of Bach.212-247-7800, carnegiehall.orgAdvertisement
