Philip Venables’s adaptation of Sarah Kane’s last play is directed by Ted Huffman and features William Cole conducting the ensemble Contemporaneous.212-647-0251, prototypefestival.orgBENJAMIN APPL at the Park Avenue Armory (Jan. 6, 3 p.m., Jan. 8 & 10, 7:30 p.m.) Appl is perhaps the leading young voice in the generation following on from the one dominated by Christian Gerhaher, and here he introduces himself in his North American recital debuts with the trilogy of late Schubert song cycles, sung in the plush Board of Officers Room: “Die Schöne Müllerin” on Sunday, “Schwanengesang” on Tuesday, and “Winterreise” on Thursday. James Baillieu is the pianist.212-249-5518, armoryonpark.orgARTEK at Corpus Christi Church (Jan 10-11, 8 p.m.) Celebrating the completion of a recording, this excellent early music group gives a complete account spread over two nights of Book 7 the Madrigals by Monteverdi, a composer with whom they have had a long and productive relationship.212-866-0468, gemsny.org‘CARMEN’ at the Metropolitan Opera (Jan. 9, 8 p.m., through Feb. 8) Carmen returns to the Met’s stage for the second time this season, in Richard Eyre’s staging. The Carmen remains Clémentine Margaine, joined now by Roberto Alagna as Don José, Aleksandra Kurzak as Micaëla and Alexander Vinogradov as Escamillo. Louis Langrée conducts.212-362-6000, metopera.orgNEW YORK PHILHARMONIC at David Geffen Hall (Jan. 10, 7:30 p.m., through Jan. 12) The up-and-coming conductor Jakub Hrusa is on the podium at the Philharmonic this week, and brings with him music from his native Czech Republic in the form of Charles Mackerras’ suite from Janacek’s “The Cunning Little Vixen.” Also on the bill are Rimsky-Korsakov’s “Scheherazade” and Prokofiev’s Piano Concerto No.3, with Simon Trpceski at the keyboard.212-875-5656, nyphil.org‘PARTITA FOR 8 VOICES’ in Times Square (Jan. 7, 4 p.m. & 7 p.m.) Caroline Shaw’s still-wondrous score, sung as ever by the vocal ensemble Roomful of Teeth, is staged in Times Square with free admission. Curated by Raul Zbengheci and directed by Ximena Garnica, the performance also features dancers from the Leimay Ensemble.212-647-0251, prototypefestival.org‘PRISM’ at La MaMa (Jan. 6-7, 9-12, 7:30 p.m.) In the course of praising this new opera — with a libretto by Roxie Perkins — upon its debut last November, the Los Angeles Times critic Mark Swed wrote that the composer Ellen Reid “is a major voice thus far mainly recognized only in L.A.” Let us hope that changes with these performances, directed by James Darrah, and in the most competent of musical hands, with Julian Wachner conducting the Choir of Trinity Wall Street and NOVUS NY.212-647-0251, prototypefestival.orgAn earlier version of this article stated that Richard Baker would conduct the ensemble Contemporaneous for the performances of “4.48 Psychosis.” Because of an illness, he has been replaced by William Cole.Advertisement
