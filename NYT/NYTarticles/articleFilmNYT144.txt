The French director Yann Gonzalez summons not just William Friedkin’s notorious 1980 thriller “Cruising,” but near-countless European giallos featuring faceless killers. His second feature is a not quite nostalgic evocation of dangerous gay living in the pre-AIDS era.Vanessa Paradis, in one of her most striking film roles since 1999’s “The Girl on the Bridge,” plays Anne, an alcoholic producer of gay porn who’s a mess since breaking up with Loïs (Kate Moran), her intrepid editor.Drunk dialing her ex yields no success in appealing to Loïs’s heart. So Anne moves to impress her artistically, initiating a film project she intends to be several cuts above her usual fare. She enthuses to her director that she’ll draw a hunky cast from “the common people,” which prompts the response, “Who are you, Zola?”At the same time, a series of murders committed with a sex toy that contains a knife blade is reducing her repertory company.This movie packs in plenty of cinema acrobatics and spectacle without ever feeling out of control, even as it morphs into a far-fetched whodunit. Gonzalez contains his love of screen excess with a deliberation that never feels contrived or cheap. His depiction of the porn-making world is affectionate without ever flinching from squirmy details (such as a fluffer whose nickname is “Bouche d’Or”). The movie is an apt, and not at all unserious, example of queer cinema at its most playful.Movie data powered by IMDb.comNot rated. In French and Spanish, with English subtitles.
