For that matter, why is this revered and treasured resource still subject to the brutal forces of free-market real estate in the Manhattan theater district? Creating an endowment of $5 million and allowing the store to operate under the auspices of a nonprofit foundation would cushion it against the marketplace and enable it to continue in the wonderful space that it now occupies on West 40th Street.This amount is small change for the New York City theater community! Get busy, folks. The Drama Book Shop helped many of you over the years by putting your work before the public when no one else would. Time to give back!Robin BreonTorontoAdvertisement
