In the Netflix film “Triple Frontier,” it takes cash. The movie focuses on former Special Forces operatives (Ben Affleck, Charlie Hunnam, Oscar Isaac, Garrett Hedlund and Pedro Pascal) who come together to bring down (and rip off) a drug dealer. Their plans don’t go as smoothly as hoped, and a turn of events finds them in a small village on the Brazilian border, doing more harm than good. Affleck’s character is charged with paying off a village elder for the damage that he and his team caused. In his narration, Chandor explains how the scene was inspired by stories he heard from real Special Ops veterans about similar payoffs to villages during times of war.Read a review of “Triple Frontier.”Sign up for the Movies Update newsletter and get a roundup of reviews, news, Critics’ Picks and more.Mekado Murphy is a senior staff editor with a focus on movies coverage.
