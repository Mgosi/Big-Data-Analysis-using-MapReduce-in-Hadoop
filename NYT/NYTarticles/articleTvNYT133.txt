It’s directed by and co-stars Mathieu Amalric; the actress in the title role, sort of, is Jeanne Balibar; Mr. Amalric and Ms. Balibar were once married. The “sort of” is because Ms. Balibar doesn’t play the title role as such. She plays an actress named Brigitte, who’s playing the real-life French singer Monique Serf, who went by the stage name Barbara, in a film directed by Yves, the character played by Mr. Amalric.Barbara, a contemporary of Jacques Brel, was a chanteuse who specialized, as is the French custom, in songs of lost love. She was hugely popular in her country — one of her records is reputed to have sold a million copies in the 12 hours after its release — and all but unknown in the United States. She died in 1997 at 67.I’m making this film sound like a potentially difficult sit. It’s not, at all. Mr. Amalric’s film has a fragmented style, depicting the shooting of various sequences in the fictional Barbara biopic, and some personal excursions of Brigitte’s, including an amorous road trip with a hunky prop man.It’s a film of scenes rather than of one unified narrative, but each scene is a showcase for the magnificent talents of Ms. Balibar, a multifaceted performer of spectacular magnetism and intelligence. Stalking a hotel room wearing only fishnet stockings and a blouse, she’s a cat on the prowl for something she can’t quite put her paw on; sitting at a piano and belting out one of Barbara’s songs, she’s the queen of French soul.Mr. Amalric plays Yves as a still-besotted fan of Barbara, and as a director he’s a still-besotted fan of Ms. Balibar’s. He is wise in his enthusiasms.Movie data powered by IMDb.comNot rated. In French and English, with English subtitles. Running time: 1 hour 38 minutes.Advertisement
