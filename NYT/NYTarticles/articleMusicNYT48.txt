The most important flutist of our time reaches the sixth part of “Density 2036,” her 23-year journey to create a wholly new repertoire for her instrument. Although Chase is joined by the polymath composer Tyshawn Sorey for performances of his “Bertha’s Lair,” revised after its premiere earlier in this series, the new pieces here are all by women. Olga Neuwirth’s “Magic Flu-idity” is for flute and typewriter; Pamela Z’s “Louder, Warmer, Denser” is for flute and fixed media; Phyllis Chen’s “Blood Beat” includes a part for live heartbeat; and Sarah Hennies’s “Reservoir 2: Intrusion” stars the voices of Constellation Chor.212-255-5793, thekitchen.orgCHIAROSCURO QUARTET AND KRISTIAN BEZUIDENHOUT at Zankel Hall (March 4, 7:30 p.m.). Period instruments all around in this concert, as a leading fortepianist joins a strong quartet led by the noted soloist Alina Ibragimova. On the bill are Schubert’s “Death and the Maiden” quartet, Mozart’s Piano Sonata in C minor, K. 457, and an arrangement of Mozart’s Piano Concerto No. 12 in A.212-247-7800, carnegiehall.orgLES ARTS FLORISSANTS at BAM Howard Gilman Opera House (March 1-2, 7:30 p.m.; March 3, 3 p.m.). William Christie, that stylish master of the Baroque, leads “Rameau, Maître à Danser,” a double bill of miniature, rare operas written for Louis XV by Rameau, “La Naissance d’Osiris” and “Daphnis et Églé.” The direction is by Sophie Daneman.718-636-4100, bam.org[Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.]‘LOVE IN FRAGMENTS’ at the 92nd Street Y (March 6, 7:30 p.m.). The Y begins a new, multidisciplinary series with this reflection on love. You name the medium, this program has it: music by Bach, Widmann and more, performed by the violinist Gergana Gergova and the cellist Alban Gerhardt; dance choreographed by Sommer Ulrickson; sculpture by Alexander Polzin; even projected text, taken from Roland Barthes’s “A Lover’s Discourse.”212-415-5500, 92y.orgJEAN RONDEAU at Weill Recital Hall (March 7, 7:30 p.m.). Rondeau has been more collateral damage than active combatant in the recent harpsichord wars, set off by the rebellions of Mahan Esfahani. But this young French harpsichordist is a bit of a rebel in his own right, and in more than just his choice of hairstyle. See if returns are available to hear him play music by Bach and Scarlatti.212-247-7800, carnegiehall.orgANDRÁS SCHIFF at Carnegie Hall (March 7, 8 p.m.). Janacek and Schumann from this eminence grise of the piano world: Janacek in the form of Book I of “On the Overgrown Path” and the Sonata “1.X.1905”; Schumann through the “Davidsbündlertänze” and the Piano Sonata No. 1.212-247-7800, carnegiehall.orgVIENNA PHILHARMONIC at Carnegie Hall (March 2 and 5-6, 8 p.m.; March 3, 2 p.m.). The Vienna Philharmonic is in town for four programs this week, and it will play not a bar of music composed in the past hundred years. The better evenings are likely to be the latter two, in which Michael Tilson Thomas is at the helm for Ives, Brahms and Beethoven with the pianist Igor Levit on Tuesday, and Mahler’s Symphony No. 9 on Wednesday. The first two concerts are led by Adam Fischer, and include Beethoven and Bartok on Saturday, and Haydn and Mozart on Sunday, with Leonidas Kavakos as the violin soloist.212-247-7800, carnegiehall.orgAdvertisement
