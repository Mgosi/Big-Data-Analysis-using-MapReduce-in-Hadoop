Night Shyamalan, there weren’t many twists at the box office.Universal’s “Glass,” a superhero successor to the director Shyamalan’s “Unbreakable” and “Split” that stars Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis and James McAvoy, sold an estimated $40.6 million in tickets during its first weekend in North American theaters, easily topping the chart at the end of a relatively quiet week.“Glass” completes a trilogy that started in 2000 with “Unbreakable,” a superhero thriller that introduced audiences to David Dunn (Willis), a football player-turned-security guard with superhuman abilities, and Elijah Price (Jackson), a comic-book theorist. While that film was successful at the box office and has since developed a cult following, its sales were modest compared to those of Shyamalan’s previous blockbuster, “The Sixth Sense,” which was the second-highest-grossing movie of 1999.With “Glass,” Universal was likely hoping to combine the cult status of “Unbreakable” with the box-office momentum created by “Split,” which came out in early 2017. The latter movie, which stars McAvoy as a kidnapper with multiple personalities, was a surprise hit, making about $138.3 million domestically during its time in theaters against a production budget of just $9 million, according to Box Office Mojo.“Split” made about $40 million during its opening weekend, so “Glass” is performing comparably — though it seems unlikely that the movie will wildly outpace “Split,” particularly given mixed reviews from critics. (“Glass” has a 36 percent fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes.)In her review for The New York Times, Manohla Dargis called the movie “enjoyable,” but wrote that its “air of misterioso quiet and encroaching, consuming terror give way to manly growling, jaw-clenching and vein-popping, and everything falls to pieces in a poorly conceptualized and staged blowout.”STX’s “The Upside,” which was No. 1 in ticket sales last weekend despite the controversy surrounding Kevin Hart, one of its stars, came in second place with about $15.7 million, according to Comscore, which compiles box-office data.Aside from “Glass,” the only other newcomer in the top five was Funimation’s “Dragon Ball Super: Broly,” a Japanese anime movie and the latest entry in the long-running “Dragon Ball” franchise, which made $8.7 million during its opening weekend to finish fourth.Advertisement
