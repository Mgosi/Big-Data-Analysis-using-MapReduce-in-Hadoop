Martin has written over the past 50 years — including the series that inspired HBO’s wildly popular “Game of Thrones” — it’s surprising that his work hasn’t been more widely mined by TV producers. The author wasn’t directly involved with the new adaptation of his 1980 novella “Nightflyers,” but the show still retains the heart and brain of what Martin has called his “haunted starship story.” “Nightflyers” follows a disparate band of deep-space colonists, fleeing a dying Earth while being driven to paranoia and madness by some mysterious entity. The show combines the atmospheric intergalactic terror of “Alien” with a good old-fashioned ghost story, and suggests that Martin’s back catalog might contain a gold mine of good TV material.Given how many novels and short stories George R.R.

But nothing that’s come before is quite like “Russian Doll,” an innovative comedy co-created by Natasha Lyonne, Leslye Headland and Amy Poehler. Lyonne stars as Nadia, who finds herself continuously looping around to the same party, where something disastrous always happens. With every do-over, “Russian Doll” proves constantly delightful and surprising.The “Groundhog Day” premise of the eternally resetting day has itself — somewhat ironically — been done over and over in movies and TV shows.

In season three, the blue-collar Cuban-American Alvarez family will continue to spar about hot-button political issues, while also dealing with big anxieties in their personal lives — involving career changes, romance and the persistent fear that one bad medical diagnosis or huge repair bill could upset everything they’ve been working toward.It feels like a little gift every time this critically acclaimed reimagining of Norman Lear’s long-running ’70s-and-’80s sitcom gets renewed.

The already-in-the-works second season will tell an entirely new true story, but it’ll be hard to top the cast for the first, which includes Connie Britton as Debra Newell — one of John’s victims — and Juno Temple and Jean Smart as her concerned family members.One of the many recent TV series adapted from podcasts, the eight-episode first season of “Dirty John” is about John Meehan (played by Eric Bana), a handsome and magnetic con artist known for seducing women and then slowly destroying their lives.

When the clan’s ultra-rich and ambitious patriarch dies, his adopted children are reunited and have to put aside old grudges to help save the world.The rock band My Chemical Romance’s frontman Gerard Way turned to writing comic books about a decade ago, combining his lifelong obsessions with science fiction and teen rebellion into the cult series “The Umbrella Academy.” The TV version of the comic has Ellen Page playing a non-super-powered sibling in a family of superheroes.

Still, it’s impressive that its creator, David Gelb, has been able to draw such a steady audience with a cooking show that emphasizes visual beauty and psychological inquiry over, say, instructions on how to pan-sear a tuna steak. The chefs in the sixth season include the American Southern-cooking expert Sean Brock and Asma Khan, the London-based master of Indian food.Very few Netflix originals have run for as many seasons as “Chef’s Table” (granted, each season only features four to six episodes).

An all-star cast (including Jake Gyllenhaal, Rene Russo, Toni Collette, Daveed Diggs and John Malkovich) plays a close-knit group of Los Angeles visual artists, dealers, gallery managers and critics, who are wowed by the gruesome paintings discovered in the apartment of a mysterious dead man. The first half of “Velvet Buzzsaw” is a pretty standard-issue spoof of the rich and pretentious. Then the haunted artwork starts coming to life and a whole lot of truly original weirdness ensues.Part art-world satire, part serial-killer thriller, the “Nightcrawler” writer-director Dan Gilroy’s new movie “Velvet Buzzsaw” should delight some adventurous movie buffs … and probably irritate just as many.

André Holland plays a forward-thinking agent, working with and against various factions in a pro basketball league to get the best deal — within a 72-hour window — not just for his in-demand client, but for everyone else who plays the game.

Daniel Kaluuya stars as a black photographer who agrees to meet his white girlfriend’s aggressively progressive parents, not realizing that the whole family has nefarious plans. While poking at the subtle racism of well-meaning liberals, Peele also delivers a picture filled with nail-biting suspense and pulse-pounding action.The writer-director Jordan Peele’s latest offbeat horror film “Us” is debuting in cinemas in March, so now’s a good time to revisit the comedian’s startling 2017 feature filmmaking debut: a clever low-budget thriller that went on to be one of the most financially successful and talked-about movies of that year.

Duplass and Ray Romano play neighbors who gradually become chums, bonding over a game they invented. Like a lot of Duplass’s work, “Paddleton” starts out as a film about grown men who act like goofy kids, but it takes a turn when a terminal cancer diagnosis changes the nature of the friendship and inspires a road trip.The prolific filmmaker, TV producer and actor Mark Duplass both stars in and co-wrote the dramedy “Paddleton,” alongside the movie’s director Alex Lehmann.

Her gritty urban neighborhood now sparkles. Her suddenly enormous apartment is filled with stylish furniture and clothes. She has a gay best friend. And the handsomest man she’s ever met (played by Liam Hemsworth) pursues her relentlessly. While kicking the genre around a bit, Wilson and the filmmakers still get to angle for a crowd-pleasing happy ending.Romantic comedy clichés get savaged — mostly affectionately — in the colorful “Isn’t It Romantic,” which stars the comedian Rebel Wilson as a woman who gets conked on the head and wakes up in an idealized rom-com world.
