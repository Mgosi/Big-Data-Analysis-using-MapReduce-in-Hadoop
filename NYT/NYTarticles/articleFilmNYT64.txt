Honey, they shrunk the boss in the comedy “Little.” The story follows Jordan Sanders, an aggressive business owner who wakes up one morning to find herself inhabiting her 13-year-old body. Marsai Martin portrays the little version of Jordan, and the film’s co-writer and director, Tina Gordon, finds several sources for laughs in this scenario. Issa Rae plays Jordan’s assistant, who has just discovered that while her boss is small, her bossiness still looms large. And Rachel Dratch plays a child protective services official who has been summoned to Jordan’s residence when a neighbor complains about an unattended minor on the property. Narrating this scene, Gordon discusses how the placement of living room furniture assists in the comedy, and how a photo of Barack Obama works its way into a joke.Read a review of “Little.”Sign up for the Movies Update newsletter and get a roundup of reviews, news, Critics’ Picks and more.Mekado Murphy is a senior staff editor with a focus on movies coverage.
