Partners in life are partners at the piano for this concert of works for four hands. Messiaen’s “Visions de l’Amen” is the major piece, prefaced by miniatures by Bartok, Ravel’s “Sites auriculaires” and the American premiere of Harrison Birtwistle’s “Keyboard Engine.”212-247-7800, carnegiehall.orgEMERSON STRING QUARTET AND SHAI WOSNER at Alice Tully Hall (Oct. 21, 5 p.m.). The Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center has done a better job of venturing into the music of our own time in recent years, and does so again here, with William Bolcom’s Piano Quintet No. 1. Mozart’s Piano Quartet in E flat and Dvorak’s String Quartet in G complete the program.212-875-5788, chambermusicsociety.orgELINA GARANCA at Carnegie Hall (Oct. 23, 8 p.m.). Rounding out a run singing Dalila at the Met, Garanca is joined by the pianist Malcolm Martineau for songs by Schumann, Wagner, Ravel and Falla.212-247-7800, carnegiehall.orgANGELA HEWITT at the 92nd Street Y (Oct. 21, 3 p.m.). Subtle, sensitive and supreme in Bach, Hewitt’s series devoted to the composer she has spent as much time with as anyone in recent memory continues with the entire second book of “The Well-Tempered Clavier.”212-415-5500, 92y.orgIGOR LEVIT at Zankel Hall (Oct. 19, 7:30 p.m.). Excerpts from Levit’s utterly absorbing new album are on the bill here, including Brahms’s left-hand-only version of Bach’s Chaconne, Busoni’s “Fantasia nach J.S. Bach,” Schumann’s “Ghost” Variations, Liszt’s reworking of the Solemn March to the Holy Grail from “Parsifal,” and Busoni’s transcription of Liszt’s organ work, the Fantasia and Fugue on “Ad nos, ad salutarem undam.”212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org‘MARNIE’ at the Metropolitan Opera (Oct. 19, 8 p.m.; Oct. 22, 7:30 p.m.; through Nov. 10). Nico Muhly’s second opera at this house is a gloss on the 1961 novel by Winston Graham and the 1964 film by Alfred Hitchcock, and, like Muhly’s first, “Two Boys,” it arrives via a frostily received premiere at the English National Opera. With a libretto by Nicholas Wright and in a production by Michael Mayer, it has a cast featuring Isabel Leonard in the title role, Christopher Maltman as Mark Rutland and Iestyn Davies as Terry Rutland. Robert Spano conducts.212-870-7457, metopera.orgNEW YORK PHILHARMONIC at David Geffen Hall (Oct. 25, 7:30 p.m.; through Oct. 27). It’s a mark of how progressive the music director Jaap van Zweden’s programming has been so far that the guest conductor Tugan Sokhiev’s concerts this week look so harmless. He’s an interesting conductor, though, and can be heard in Borodin, Tchaikovsky’s Symphony No. 4 and Prokofiev’s Violin Concerto No. 1. Gil Shaham is the soloist.212-875-5656, nyphil.orgTYSHAWN SOREY at the Kitchen (Oct. 21, 6 p.m.; Oct 22-23, 8 p.m.). Three nights of music by this extraordinarily talented musician, who not only plays multiple instruments, but also composes at the cutting edge of classical, jazz, everything in between, and much beyond. On Sunday, he is joined by the pianist Marilyn Crispell; on Monday, he debuts seven pieces for sextet; on Tuesday, he adds turntables, electronics and vocals to the mix.212-255-5793, thekitchen.org‘TOSCA’ at the Metropolitan Opera (Oct. 25, 7:30 p.m.; through Nov. 17). David McVicar’s ultratraditional production of Puccini’s classic returns for one of two runs this season. (The second opens in March.) Sondra Radvanovsky sings Tosca, with Joseph Calleja as her Cavaradossi, and Zeljko Lucic as Scarpia. Carlo Rizzi wields the baton.212-870-7457, metopera.orgRALPH VAN RAAT at Weill Recital Hall (Oct. 24, 7:30 p.m.). This concert has the whiff of an occasion about it. Not only is there the premiere of “Searching for Unison,” a new commission by Louis Andriessen, who seems to be everywhere at the moment, but also a virtually unheard piece by Debussy, Alkan’s stomach-churningly difficult Symphony for Solo Piano, and, believe it or not, the American premiere of a newly discovered piece by Pierre Boulez, the “Prelude, Toccata, and Scherzo,” dating to around 1944.212-247-7800, carnegiehall.orgAdvertisement
