Narrating the scene, Peele discusses how he was inspired by scenes from the movies “Halloween” and “Poltergeist” in the way he built suspense in the sequence. He also talks about how he wrote the actions of the father character in a way that interrogates his own anxieties about parenthood.Read a review of “Us.”Sign up for the Movies Update newsletter and get a roundup of reviews, news, Critics’ Picks and more.Mekado Murphy is a senior staff editor with a focus on movies coverage.
