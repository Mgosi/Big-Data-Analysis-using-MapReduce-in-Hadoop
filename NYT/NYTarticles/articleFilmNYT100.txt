There’s a lesson to be learned in this scene from the Neil Jordan thriller “Greta.” Do not serve Isabelle Huppert bad wine. In the sequence, Frances (Chloë Grace Moretz) waits tables at a New York restaurant. She is surprised to find that Greta (Huppert), the woman who has been stalking and harassing her, has booked a table. One line of dialogue that Greta delivers gives a sense of her manipulative bitterness: When she tries a glass of Chablis, she says to Frances that it’s “a bit like you. Promises a lot, then disappoints.”Maybe a pinot noir next time?In his narration, Jordan discusses how the restaurant was both designed and filmed in a way to maximize Frances’s humiliation, how Greta’s fashionable wardrobe factors in (she’s wearing Chanel) and how, even though it’s Greta who’s the threat, the crew worked to make sure Huppert felt physically comfortable in playing these aggressive moments.Read a review of “Greta.”Sign up for the Movies Update newsletter and get a roundup of reviews, news, Critics’ Picks and more.Mekado Murphy is a senior staff editor with a focus on movies coverage.
