AdvertisementSupported byBy David AllenOur guide to the city’s best classical music and opera happening this weekend and in the week ahead.‘THE CREATION’ at Alice Tully Hall (Nov. 15, 7:30 p.m.). William Christie, stylish in everything he conducts, leads Les Arts Florissants in Haydn’s great oratorio. The vocal soloists are Sandrine Piau, Hugo Hymas and Alex Rosen. This event is sold out, so act fast and check for returns.212-721-6500, lincolncenter.orgDU YUN at Miller Theater (Nov. 15, 8 p.m.). Following quickly from Kate Soper’s composer portrait, the Miller now looks at another leading force on the New York scene, Du Yun, whose “Angel’s Bone” (an “appallingly good work,” as my colleague Corinna da Fonseca-Wollheim put it) happened to win the 2017 Pulitzer Prize for which Soper was a finalist. The International Contemporary Ensemble is on hand to play music that overflows, often raucously, with ideas.212-854-7799, millertheatre.comRICHARD GOODE at the 92nd Street Y (Nov. 14, 7:30 p.m.). Still among the most rewarding pianists around, Goode here feasts on Haydn’s immense set of double variations in F minor, five shorter pieces by Mozart, Beethoven’s “Les Adieux” Sonata, Janacek’s “In the Mists” and, as if all that were not enough, a dessert of Chopin.212-415-5500, 92y.orgMARC-ANDRÉ HAMELIN at Carnegie Hall (Nov. 15, 8 p.m.). There’s a blend of core repertoire and pieces found far from the beaten path in this supreme pianist’s Carnegie recital this season, with Schumann’s Fantasy in C, Bach’s Chaconne in Busoni’s reworking, and two pieces by Chopin nestled alongside Alexis Weissenberg’s “Six Arrangements of Songs Sung by Charles Trénet” and Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco’s “Cypresses.”212-247-7800, carnegiehall.orgJACK QUARTET at the 92nd Street Y (Nov. 9, 9 p.m.). A later-night session from the nation’s most important quartet includes Andreia Pinto Correia’s String Quartet No. 1 (“Unvanquished Space”), Sabrina Schroeder’s “Slip Trains,” Zosha Di Castri’s String Quartet No. 1 and Ligeti’s String Quartet No. 2.212-415-5500, 92y.orgNEW YORK PHILHARMONIC at David Geffen Hall (Nov. 15, 7:30 p.m.; Nov. 16-17, 8 p.m.). Manfred Honeck returns to the Philharmonic’s podium, and with music with which he has a real affinity. Dvorak’s “Carnival” Overture and Martinu’s Violin Concerto No. 1 (with Frank Peter Zimmermann) make up the first half, but the real fireworks come in the second, as this former violist in the Vienna Philharmonic leads music by Johann Strauss II and Josef Strauss — including “The Blue Danube.”212-875-5656, nyphil.org‘LES PÊCHEURS DE PERLES’ at the Metropolitan Opera (Nov. 14, 7:30 p.m.; through Dec. 8). Returning after its premiere in the 2015-16 season, this Penny Woolcock production of Bizet’s other major opera features Pretty Yende as Leïla (except for the Dec. 8 performance), Javier Camarena as Nadir and Mariusz Kwiecien as Zurga. Emmanuel Villaume conducts.212-870-7457, metopera.orgPHILADELPHIA ORCHESTRA at Carnegie Hall (Nov. 13, 8 p.m.). Yannick Nézet-Séguin conducts a program that seems designed, more than anything, to show off this ensemble’s lush sound. There is music by Wagner, Respighi and Mason Bates, but Joyce DiDonato is the star attraction, singing Chausson’s “Poème de l’amour et de la mer.”212-247-7800, carnegiehall.orgAdvertisement
