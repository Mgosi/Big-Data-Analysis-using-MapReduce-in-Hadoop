Sondra Radvanovsky sings the title role for just three performances in this brief reprise of the one of the Met’s most famous and opulent productions, and they should not be missed. Jorge de León is Radamès, Olesya Petrova is Amneris, Stefan Kocan is Ramfis and Soloman Howard is the King. Plácido Domingo conducts.212-362-6000, metopera.orgETHEL at the Jewish Museum (Feb. 28, 7:30 p.m.). Julia Wolfe has become most notable in recent years for working on a large scale, particularly with “Fire in My Mouth” and her Pulitzer Prize-winning “Anthracite Fields,” but here is an opportunity to delve deep into her chamber music, with a first-ever concert of her complete string quartets performed by the contemporary foursome Ethel.212-423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org‘FALSTAFF’ at the Metropolitan Opera (Feb. 22 and 27, 8 p.m.; through March 16). Ambrogio Maestri returns for Verdi’s late, great comedy to sing the lead, a role that the baritone owns. Robert Carsen’s production was widely acclaimed when it first appeared at the Met in 2013, and benefits here from a cast that includes Golda Schultz as Nannetta, Ailyn Peréz as Alice, Marie-Nicole Lemieux as Mistress Quickly and Jennifer Johnson Cano as Meg Page. Richard Farnes conducts.212-362-6000, metopera.orgNEW YORK PHILHARMONIC at David Geffen Hall (Feb. 28, 7:30 p.m.; through March 2). Herbert Blomstedt, that 91-year-old miracle of spirit and smiles, mounts the podium to conduct Dvorak’s Symphony No. 8 and Grieg’s Suite No. 1 from “Peer Gynt,” as well as his Piano Concerto. Jean-Yves Thibaudet is the pianist.212-875-5656, nyphil.org[Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.]ORCHESTRA OF ST. LUKE’S at Carnegie Hall (Feb. 28, 8 p.m.). There’s nothing more innovative in this program than Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven, but sometimes there’s nothing more satisfying than Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven. The orchestra’s principal conductor, Bernard Labadie, leads Haydn’s overture to “L’Isola Disabitata” and his Symphony No. 45, the “Farewell,” as well as Beethoven’s Piano Concerto No. 2 and Mozart’s concert aria “Non temer, amato bene.” The soloists are luxury casting: Paul Lewis is at the keyboard; Ying Fang is the soprano.212-247-7800, carnegiehall.orgMATTHEW POLENZANI at Zankel Hall (Feb. 24, 3 p.m.). One of the Met’s leading tenors appears with the pianist Julius Drake for a recital featuring Schubert, Beethoven, Brahms and, most intriguingly, Janacek, in the form of “The Diary of One Who Disappeared,” for which Polenzani is joined by the mezzo Jennifer Johnson Cano and a trio of offstage female voices.212-247-7800, carnegiehall.orgINBAL SEGEV at Roulette (Feb. 28, 8 p.m.). This recital, titled “21st Century Women,” features Segev playing recent solo cello works by five of our more prominent female composers.
