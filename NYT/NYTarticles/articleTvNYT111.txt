Come back every Friday for new suggestions on what to watch.‘Gourmet Makes’ When to watch: Now, on YouTube.On each episode of this web series from the magazine Bon Appétit, the intrepid and cheery chef Claire Saffitz attempts to make an at-home, gourmet version of popular junk food — Twinkies, Pringles, Cheetos, etc. The processes are frequently too advanced to recreate yourself, sometimes because the kitchen equipment is esoteric but more often because Saffitz’s meticulousness is superhuman. If you want a cooking show that’s funny and lively but isn’t a competition, try this.‘Hang-Ups’ When to watch: Now, on Hulu.America loves remaking British shows, but this is the rare series that moved in the other direction: It’s a (loosely adapted) British version of the American comedy “Web Therapy.” Stephen Mangan stars as Richard, a therapist who begrudgingly starts seeing patients by webcam. The dialogue is largely improvised, which on other shows can be deflating, but here lends a live-wire, almost antic energy.‘Losers’When to watch: Now, on Netflix.Sports documentaries are easy to love, and this eight-part series makes that even easier by profiling not the untouchable heroes but the intriguing athletes who came up short. “Losers” blends regular documentary footage with evocative animation, which makes the small moments more intimate and emotional and the big moments feel like a fairy tale. The episodes are all solid, but the standouts are about the French figure skater Surya Bonaly and the Canadian curler Pat Ryan.Advertisement
