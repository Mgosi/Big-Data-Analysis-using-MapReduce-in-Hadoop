Written and directed by Jennifer Kaytin Robinson, the film kicks into action when the college sweethearts Jenny (Gina Rodriguez) and Nate (Lakeith Stanfield) call it quits after nine years.Jenny’s new job requires a move across the country, and Nate decides to break it off rather than deal with dating long distance. As a goodbye and a way of taking her mind off her heartbreak, Jenny’s best friends, Blair (Brittany Snow) and Erin (DeWanda Wise), take her out for one last night on the town.What follows is a story about the lasting bonds of friendship dressed in the clothes of a romantic drama. The dynamic between the three leads is the film’s best quality, but the flashbacks to scenes from Jenny’s relationship with Nate take up more of the film’s attention. The other women are saddled with romance troubles of their own: Blair is in a long-term relationship that has turned lifeless; Erin is afraid of commitment.Both story lines are fun, as each member of the cast is endlessly charming, but they feel like separate movies. There’s a “Blue Valentine”-like drama starring Rodriguez and Stanfield on one side, and a studio comedy on the other.The film succeeds, however, in capturing the way that certain places and songs can take on a life of their own, triggering sense memories of the moments associated with them. The hooks on which “Someone Great” chooses to hang its emotional hats are a little clichéd, but Rodriguez, Snow and Wise have enough chemistry to pull it all off.Movie data powered by IMDb.comSomeone GreatRated R for raunchiness and rave-adjacent drug consumption.
