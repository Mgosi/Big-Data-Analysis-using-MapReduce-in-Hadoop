Who else but Leon Botstein and his ensemble would come up with a program like this, filled with orchestral music by New York composers from the middle of the last century. The most famous work is probably Schuman’s Symphony No. 3, preceded by Robert Mann’s “Fantasy for Orchestra,” Vivian Fine’s “Concertante for Piano and Orchestra” and Jacob Druckman’s “Prism.” Charlie Albright is at the keyboard.212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org‘DON GIOVANNI’ at the Metropolitan Opera (Jan. 30, 7:30 p.m.; through Feb. 20). Despite its rather downbeat reception, Michael Grandage’s production returns again, for the first of two runs this season. (There are five performances in April.) Luca Pisaroni is Don Giovanni, with Ildar Abdrazakov as his Leporello. Rachel Willis-Sorensen sings Anna, Federica Lombardi sings Elvira and Aida Garifullina is Zerlina, with Stanislas de Barbeyrac as Ottavio, Brandon Cedel as Masetto and Stefan Kocan as the Commendatore. Cornelius Meister conducts.212-362-6000, metopera.orgDAVID GREILSAMMER at National Sawdust (Jan. 26, 7 p.m.). Greilsammer is something of a specialist at juxtaposing the new, and here we find him at the same tricks again. Two composers: Scarlatti and Cage. Two pianos: one traditional, one prepared. One genre: the sonata. Usually it all comes together.646-779-8455, nationalsawdust.org[Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.]STEFAN JACKIW AND CONRAD TAO at the 92nd Street Y (Jan. 25, 9 p.m.).

In this first concert, with Sachs conducting, there are pieces by Younghi Pagh-Paan, Colin Matthews, Salvatore Sciarrino and Akira Nishimura. Note, too, the last concert of the festival, on Feb. 1, in which Gil Rose conducts the Juilliard Orchestra in music by Betty Olivero, Gyorgy Ligeti and Michael Tippett.212-799-5000, juilliard.eduNEW YORK PHILHARMONIC at David Geffen Hall (Jan. 30, 7:30 p.m., through Feb. 2).
