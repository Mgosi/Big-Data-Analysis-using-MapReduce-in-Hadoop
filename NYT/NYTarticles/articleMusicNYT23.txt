Accomplishing quite the feat of modern music, this indefatigable foursome plays the five complete quartets of Elliott Carter, a body of music stretching from 1951 to 1995. 212-685-0008, themorgan.orgJUILLIARD415 at the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine (April 16, 7:30 p.m.). For Holy Week, the seven movements of Haydn’s “The Seven Last Words of Christ” are paired with companion commissions by the contemporary composers Jessica Meyer, Colin Jacobsen, Nico Muhly, Tania León, Reena Esmail, Paola Prestini and Caroline Shaw. 212-799-5000, juilliard.eduDAVID T. LITTLE at Miller Theater (April 18, 8 p.m.). Little is perhaps best and deservedly known for his operas, including “Dog Days” and “JFK,” so this composer portrait is a welcome opportunity to hear some of his instrumental music. Not that the music to be played here sets aside the political approach that he has taken in so much of his work. “Haunt of Last Nightfall,” for percussion quartet and electronics, takes its story from the 1981 El Mozote massacre in El Salvador by soldiers trained by the United States military; “AGENCY,” for string quartet and electronics, is a work about secrecy, itself written using ciphers. Third Coast Percussion and the American Contemporary Music Ensemble are on hand to perform. 212-854-7799, millertheatre.com[Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.]LONDON PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA at David Geffen Hall (April 14, 3 p.m.; April 15, 8 p.m.).

The English Concert’s annual performances of Handel oratorios and operas at Carnegie, under Harry Bicket, have been surefire hits for the past several years.
