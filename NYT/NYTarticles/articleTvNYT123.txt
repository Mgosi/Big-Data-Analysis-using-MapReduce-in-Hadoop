This documentary, directed by Ross Kauffman, at least partly illustrates that principle. You leave with an appreciation for the movements and instincts of an animal of which there are fewer than 4,000 left in the wild, The New York Times wrote in October.But “Tigerland” falls into a common trap of advocacy documentaries, which is to inform on an urgent issue — preserving a species — without a particularly urgent cinematic narrative to match it. Hopping between India, where the film explores the legacy of Sankhala and his descendants, and Russia, where it follows another conservationist, Pavel Fomenko, the movie gives a sense of these advocates’ passion but little more.As relayed here, the sociological history — how killing tigers was seen as a symbol of power in colonial India; how the fall of the Soviet Union led to a rise in the exploitation of natural resources, with poaching a part of that — helps to steer the movie away from generic uplift, as does Fomenko, who emerges as the most interesting subject.Shown in an early moment examining a dead tiger to determine whether it was killed illegally, Fomenko spends the bulk of the movie trying to rescue a mother tiger and her two cubs and relocate them farther from humans. (The mother has attacked pet dogs.) His thread includes one of the few developments that captures the tiger at its fiercest.Movie data powered by IMDb.comNot rated.
