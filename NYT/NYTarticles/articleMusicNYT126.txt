Is there a major orchestra playing today that is as closely associated with the music of its own country as this? Probably not, so Saturday’s concert of Dvorak’s Cello Concerto (with Alisa Weilerstein) and his Symphony No. 7 is a welcome opportunity to hear it in the flesh. The conductor Semyon Bychkov, in his first season as the music director in Prague, should also be enlightening in Mahler’s Symphony No. 2 on Sunday. The soloists are Christiane Karg and Elisabeth Kulman, with the Prague Philharmonic Choir in tow.212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org‘IPSA DIXIT’ at Miller Theater (Oct. 27, 8 p.m.). When the Miller’s composer portraits focus on those who already have a strong presence in New York, the programs tend to delve into rarer repertoire. Not here, though, and happily so. Kate Soper’s “Ipsa Dixit” (“She, Herself, Said It”) was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in 2017, and it deserves to be heard again and again. This “philosophy-opera,” as The New Yorker critic Alex Ross called it, sets voice, violin, flute and percussion to texts by writers from Aristotle and Wittgenstein to Lydia Davis and Jenny Holzer. Players from the Wet Ink Ensemble perform alongside Soper, in a production by Ashley Tata.212-854-7799, millertheatre.comMARIINSKY ORCHESTRA at Carnegie Hall (Oct. 31-Nov. 1, 8 p.m.). Valery Gergiev is back again, with his St. Petersburg band, and this year the programs are a little more interesting than has been the norm. Wednesday’s concert in particular should excite, with a complete performance of Tchaikovsky’s “The Nutcracker,” a piece that this orchestra plays with authority. Nelson Freire, a commanding pianist who remains too little heard in New York, is at the keyboard for Brahms’s Piano Concerto No. 2 on Thursday, before Gergiev leads Strauss’s “Ein Heldenleben.”212-247-7800, carnegiehall.orgNEW YORK PHILHARMONIC at David Geffen Hall (Oct. 31-Nov. 1, 7:30 p.m.; through Nov. 3). Juraj Valcuha is on the podium for these concerts, leading Rachmaninoff’s Symphonic Dances, a suite from Korngold’s incidental music for “Much Ado About Nothing” and Barber’s Violin Concerto. The Philharmonic’s concertmaster, Frank Huang, is the soloist.212-875-5656, nyphil.orgGARRICK OHLSSON at the 92nd Street Y (Oct. 27, 8 p.m.). Not content with hosting Angela Hewitt’s ongoing survey of Bach, the 92Y now kicks off a complete traversal of Brahms’s piano works in Ohlsson’s safe hands. In this first concert, he plays the Op. 10 Ballades, the Op. 76 Eight Pieces for Piano, and three sets of variations, including Book 1 of the Paganini Variations, Op. 35.212-415-5500, 92y.orgMAXIM VENGEROV AND ROUSTEM SAITKOULOV at Carnegie Hall (Oct. 30, 8 p.m.). Violin virtuosity in the good old-fashioned sense here, with Brahms’s Violin Sonata No. 3, Enescu’s Violin Sonata No. 2, Ravel’s Violin Sonata, and pieces by Ernst and Paganini.212-247-7800, carnegiehall.orgVOX LUMINIS at Corpus Christi Church (Oct. 28, 4 p.m.). An excellent Belgian choir, led by Lionel Meunier, sings its way through five of Bach’s motets, including the towering “Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied” and the heartbreaking miniature “Ich lasse dich nicht.”212-666-9266, mb1800.orgYUJA WANG at Carnegie Hall (Oct. 26, 8 p.m.). The first of Wang’s Perspectives concerts this season offers repertoire completely out of left field. Joined by four percussionists — Martin Grubinger, Martin Grubinger Sr., Leonhard Schmidinger and Alexander Georgiev — she plays arrangements for piano and percussion of Bartok’s Sonata for Two Pianos and Percussion, John Psathas’s “One Study,” Arturo Marquez’s Danzón No. 2 and, astonishingly, Stravinsky’s “The Rite of Spring.”212-247-7800, carnegiehall.orgAdvertisement
