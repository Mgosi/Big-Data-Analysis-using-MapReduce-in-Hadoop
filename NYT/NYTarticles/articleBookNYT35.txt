"Gore Vidal" features conservations between the author-playwright and Paul Jay, founder of The Real News Network, a nonprofit with a stated mission of "independent, verifiable, fact-based journalism."Vidal, who died in 2012 at age 86, had a longtime aversion to U.S. military force and surveillance.Assange hadn't left the embassy since 2012 for fear of arrest and extradition to the U.S. for publishing thousands of classified military and diplomatic cables.Advertisement
