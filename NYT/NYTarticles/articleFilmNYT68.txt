Now what? Many a comic-book origin story movie has had to answer this question, and “Shazam!” approaches it with both a light touch and a heavy splat. In this scene, Zachary Levi plays Billy, a boy recently imbued with new powers (along with an adult body). His foster brother Freddy (Jack Dylan Grazer) helps him figure out just what those powers are in a sequence that involves a painful-looking stunt leap and some pyrotechnics. In commentary, the director David F. Sandberg discusses how he worked out the comic timing with Levi and Grazer, and how he gave the Michael Bay treatment to a transformer (but not that kind of transformer).
