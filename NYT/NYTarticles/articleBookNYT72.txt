U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders raised $5.9 million in the first day after announcing his candidacy, and later disclosed he had raised $10 million in a week.Fundraising has become an early way to prove to donors and potential supporters that a candidate is viable.Donations to Booker averaged about $34, with 82 percent of the donors new supporters of the candidate, spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said on Twitter.Candidates are required by law to report all campaign donations, and cannot accept more than $2,800 from a single donor during the primary race.U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has said that her campaign would not hold any formal fundraising events and instead rely solely on "small-dollar" donations, or contributions collected online.
