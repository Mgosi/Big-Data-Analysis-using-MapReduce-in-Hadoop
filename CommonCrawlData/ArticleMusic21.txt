James Blake’s Assume Form tour made its way to the Hollywood Palladium in Los Angeles, California, on Saturday night (Mar. 16). A full crowd of every age, ethnicity and personal style packed tightly toward the stage as they anxiously awaited the headliner to make his appearance.   After a number of chants and moments of applause, Blake and his two band members took the stage and delved into the dynamic title track from the crooner’s latest EP, Assume Form.    His audience of new fans who discovered his talent from the 2019 EP were just as captivated as his fervent, longtime supporters decked in 2016 tour merch. Anywhere you looked, a free-spirited concertgoer could be spotted twirling and swaying their hips, dancing like no one is watching in the thick of a packed crowd. The infectious energy was translated through the light show onstage, a mix of colors and a smoke machine to evoke the perfect emotions and accompany the ethereal set (listed below.)

    Blake took a moment to thank everyone for listening to his album, promising to play as much of it as possible. ROSALIA's voice echoed through the venue as he mused the dreamy "Barefoot in the Park" lyrics: "Who needs to pray?/Who needs balance?/I'll see you every day."   As expected, he did live up to his promise. Besides "Barefoot in the Park" and the title track, the English star played a number of songs from his recent record, including "Are You in Love," "Can't Believe the Way We Flow" and "Where's the Catch," complete with an introduction by the song's feature, André 3000, met with venue-shaking cheers from the crowd.To end his 14-song set, Blake took an emotional turn, treating the crowd to his honey-voiced cover of Joni Mitchell's "A Case of You." But that wasn't all: after a minute or two of undying cheers, Blake returned to the stage to deliver a stripped-back encore of "Don't Miss It" and "Lullaby for My Insomniac." Hollywood Palladium set list:"Assume Form""Life Round Here""Timeless""Mile High""I'll Come Too""Barefoot in the Park""The Limit to Your Love" (Feist cover)"Are You in Love?""Can't Believe the Way We Flow""Loathe to Roam""Where's the Catch?""Voyeur""Retrograde""A Case of You" (Joni Mitchell cover)Encore:"Don't Miss It""Lullaby for My Insomniac"The online extension of Billboard Magazine, billboard.biz is the essential online destination for the music business.Learn More© 2019 Billboard.
