By Willing DavidsonJanuary 25, 2016Your story in this week’s issue, “The Philosophers,” makes up part of a larger work, called “Inherited Disorders,” which will be out in May. The book, like “The Philosophers,” is about fathers and sons, usually about the sons being inadvertently destroyed by the fathers. What was the genesis of this book? How is your relationship with your father? And did the stories all come one after another, or did the theme emerge only slowly?The theme was there from the start, but the form took a while to find. First I tried to write a more conventional novel about fathers and sons. I would start with a father and a son arranged in some extremely ironic configuration, as in these stories, but then I would make the son sort of amble over to the father, in a realist mode, and say something, and the novel would fall apart. The next morning I would start from scratch, with a slightly different extremely ironic configuration, and one character would go over to the other and say something and the novel would fall apart. This went on for several years, during which I felt and probably seemed increasingly crazy. Finally I realized that instead of representing the psychology of the relationship directly, realistically, which I was evidently bad at and didn’t enjoy, I could let it emerge indirectly from the juxtaposition of dozens of these ironic configurations, each standing on its own and spun out according to its own logic.I have a great relationship with my father! Dysfunctional relationships are less interesting to me than the seam of dysfunction that runs through every relationship, rendering communication impossible, imprisoning us in our own heads, etc.There’s something appealingly mathematical about these stories: you can see them as variations, or iterations, on a theme. In a way, there’s something formulaic about them—in a good way! Were there models you drew on, works that are more experimental than much mainstream fiction? Did you have a phase of writing more realistic work, before ditching it?Yes, many models. I’m drawn to fiction that seems to consist of some obscure logic working itself out, rather than a series of plot points. So: Kafka. But also the deranged conceptual analysis of Thomas Bernhard, the rigorous whimsy of Daniil Kharms, the absurd inquiries of Gert Hofmann. Borges, Beckett, Calvino, and Kleist. More recently: Lydia Davis and Donald Antrim. I also had in mind the repetitions and permutations of sketch comedy, philosophy, and children’s books.One of the qualities that makes the stories so good, to my mind, is that they combine that commitment to working out a formula with a real sense of humor and pleasure in the sound of the writing. How careful were you to ensure that the stories weren’t just exercises?In my favorite fiction, I get the feeling that the successful working-out of the book’s logic is somehow important for the continued sanity of its author. For me, Calvino and Borges, as great as they are, are sometimes too placid and controlled—too sane—to match the best of Kafka and Bernhard. I guess, like some outdated Romantic, I want my writers constantly teetering on the edge of a breakdown? Anyway, among other shortcomings, I am definitely too sane, so when a story went wrong, as it often did, it usually resulted in a way-too-controlled illustration or parody of some thought or idea, which is what I think of as an exercise. Those are the stories I tried to cut from the book, though I’m sure some remain.Do you feel done with patrimony? What would you like to tackle next?You know those comedy bits that involve repeating the same gag until it becomes tedious, and then pushing through until it becomes funny again? I’m hoping that a writing career can be something like that. Which is to say: I’m not sure I’m done with patrimony just yet.

I also had in mind the repetitions and permutations of sketch comedy, philosophy, and children’s books.One of the qualities that makes the stories so good, to my mind, is that they combine that commitment to working out a formula with a real sense of humor and pleasure in the sound of the writing. How careful were you to ensure that the stories weren’t just exercises?In my favorite fiction, I get the feeling that the successful working-out of the book’s logic is somehow important for the continued sanity of its author. For me, Calvino and Borges, as great as they are, are sometimes too placid and controlled—too sane—to match the best of Kafka and Bernhard. I guess, like some outdated Romantic, I want my writers constantly teetering on the edge of a breakdown? Anyway, among other shortcomings, I am definitely too sane, so when a story went wrong, as it often did, it usually resulted in a way-too-controlled illustration or parody of some thought or idea, which is what I think of as an exercise. Those are the stories I tried to cut from the book, though I’m sure some remain.Do you feel done with patrimony? What would you like to tackle next?You know those comedy bits that involve repeating the same gag until it becomes tedious, and then pushing through until it becomes funny again? I’m hoping that a writing career can be something like that. Which is to say: I’m not sure I’m done with patrimony just yet. But I am looking for a new form.More:Short storiesDive into the world of literature with The New Yorker’s weekly fiction newsletter.SubmitPhotograph by Lulu LiuPhotograph by Lulu LiuPhotograph by Lulu LiuYour story in this week’s issue, “The Philosophers,” makes up part of a larger work, called “Inherited Disorders,” which will be out in May. The book, like “The Philosophers,” is about fathers and sons, usually about the sons being inadvertently destroyed by the fathers. What was the genesis of this book? How is your relationship with your father? And did the stories all come one after another, or did the theme emerge only slowly?The theme was there from the start, but the form took a while to find. First I tried to write a more conventional novel about fathers and sons. I would start with a father and a son arranged in some extremely ironic configuration, as in these stories, but then I would make the son sort of amble over to the father, in a realist mode, and say something, and the novel would fall apart. The next morning I would start from scratch, with a slightly different extremely ironic configuration, and one character would go over to the other and say something and the novel would fall apart. This went on for several years, during which I felt and probably seemed increasingly crazy. Finally I realized that instead of representing the psychology of the relationship directly, realistically, which I was evidently bad at and didn’t enjoy, I could let it emerge indirectly from the juxtaposition of dozens of these ironic configurations, each standing on its own and spun out according to its own logic.I have a great relationship with my father! Dysfunctional relationships are less interesting to me than the seam of dysfunction that runs through every relationship, rendering communication impossible, imprisoning us in our own heads, etc.There’s something appealingly mathematical about these stories: you can see them as variations, or iterations, on a theme. In a way, there’s something formulaic about them—in a good way! Were there models you drew on, works that are more experimental than much mainstream fiction? Did you have a phase of writing more realistic work, before ditching it?Yes, many models. I’m drawn to fiction that seems to consist of some obscure logic working itself out, rather than a series of plot points. So: Kafka. But also the deranged conceptual analysis of Thomas Bernhard, the rigorous whimsy of Daniil Kharms, the absurd inquiries of Gert Hofmann. Borges, Beckett, Calvino, and Kleist. More recently: Lydia Davis and Donald Antrim.
