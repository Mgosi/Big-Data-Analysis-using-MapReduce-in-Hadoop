Spark Capital's Megan Quinn will join Niantic's board as a result of the deal.In an email, CEO John Hanke spoke of the "new strategic opportunities" the funding would open up for Niantic, including "long-term investments" in AR.Hanke has talked publicly about his belief in the potential of the AR market, going so far as to critique the capaibilities of the iPhone X for placing too much emphasis on the visual component of the experience. Niantic CTO Phil Keslin made similar comments shortly after, when he suggested that audio would be a key feature in the studio's future products.One of those products will be a game based on the Harry Potter universe.
