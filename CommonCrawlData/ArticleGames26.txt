													Dirty Harry rumours start feeling lucky, punk											

														Warner Bros is apparently touting its world famous cop franchise to developers, asking them to pitch to take control of the most powerful handgun in the world.

British sources have revealed to Eurogamer that Warner Bros is inviting developers to make pitches for a Dirty Harry game.
Two outfits have already submitted proposals for the license, although the identities of the companies in question have yet to emerge.
The news, likely to blow plenty of heads clean off, emerges on the back of the recent successes of interactive versions of key 70s franchises, such as The Dukes of Hazard and Starsky & Hutch.
No announcement has been made by Warner Bros of the intention to develop the game as yet, and no response to enquiries had been made at the time of writing.
Dirty Harry, released in 1971, is one of Clint Eastwood’s most famous films, arriving after his classic Leone westerns. Pointing a Magnum in someone’s face is always good for a laugh, and Eastwood managed to do it accompanied by more testosterone than had ever existed in the world’s combine male population.
While the game is so early the developer has not even been decided on, the mere prospect of a game where you get to play out your most rabid, macho, lead-slinging, my-way-or-the-highway, scowling, punk-whacking, flare-wearing fantasies should be more than enough for any self-respecting game fan. Watch for confirmation - but with the project possibly as much as three years away, we could be in for a long wait before we hear any more.

													Dirty Harry rumours start feeling lucky, punk											

														Warner Bros is apparently touting its world famous cop franchise to developers, asking them to pitch to take control of the most powerful handgun in the world.						






Patrick Garratt

Contributor


British sources have revealed to Eurogamer that Warner Bros is inviting developers to make pitches for a Dirty Harry game.
Two outfits have already submitted proposals for the license, although the identities of the companies in question have yet to emerge.
The news, likely to blow plenty of heads clean off, emerges on the back of the recent successes of interactive versions of key 70s franchises, such as The Dukes of Hazard and Starsky & Hutch.
No announcement has been made by Warner Bros of the intention to develop the game as yet, and no response to enquiries had been made at the time of writing.
Dirty Harry, released in 1971, is one of Clint Eastwood’s most famous films, arriving after his classic Leone westerns. Pointing a Magnum in someone’s face is always good for a laugh, and Eastwood managed to do it accompanied by more testosterone than had ever existed in the world’s combine male population.
While the game is so early the developer has not even been decided on, the mere prospect of a game where you get to play out your most rabid, macho, lead-slinging, my-way-or-the-highway, scowling, punk-whacking, flare-wearing fantasies should be more than enough for any self-respecting game fan. Watch for confirmation - but with the project possibly as much as three years away, we could be in for a long wait before we hear any more.

													Dirty Harry rumours start feeling lucky, punk											

														Warner Bros is apparently touting its world famous cop franchise to developers, asking them to pitch to take control of the most powerful handgun in the world.						






Patrick Garratt

Contributor


British sources have revealed to Eurogamer that Warner Bros is inviting developers to make pitches for a Dirty Harry game.
Two outfits have already submitted proposals for the license, although the identities of the companies in question have yet to emerge.
The news, likely to blow plenty of heads clean off, emerges on the back of the recent successes of interactive versions of key 70s franchises, such as The Dukes of Hazard and Starsky & Hutch.
No announcement has been made by Warner Bros of the intention to develop the game as yet, and no response to enquiries had been made at the time of writing.
Dirty Harry, released in 1971, is one of Clint Eastwood’s most famous films, arriving after his classic Leone westerns. Pointing a Magnum in someone’s face is always good for a laugh, and Eastwood managed to do it accompanied by more testosterone than had ever existed in the world’s combine male population.
While the game is so early the developer has not even been decided on, the mere prospect of a game where you get to play out your most rabid, macho, lead-slinging, my-way-or-the-highway, scowling, punk-whacking, flare-wearing fantasies should be more than enough for any self-respecting game fan. Watch for confirmation - but with the project possibly as much as three years away, we could be in for a long wait before we hear any more.
