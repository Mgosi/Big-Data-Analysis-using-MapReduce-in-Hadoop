The Red Hot Chili Peppers performed in front of Egypt’s Great Pyramids of Giza on Friday (March 15), celebrating their epic show with a site-appropriate cover of Radiohead’s “Pyramid Song.”During the band’s YouTube live-streamed landmark event, guitarist Josh Klinghoffer gave a potent solo piano rendition of the haunting Amnesiac track. Some might remember that the two legendary rock bands share a small connection, as Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke and the Pepper’s Flea are bandmates in their Atoms for Peace side project.
