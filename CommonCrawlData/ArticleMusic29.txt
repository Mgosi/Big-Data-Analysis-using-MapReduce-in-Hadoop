The ‘90s are long gone, but that doesn’t mean the decade is forgotten -- especially since some of the best Latin hits were born during this time.Many artists of today have grabbed an old-school jam, giving it their own, unique twist and vibe. Most recently, De La Ghetto released his single “Recuerdo,” paying tribute to Vico C’s classic urban tune “Me Acuerdo” released in 1990. Daddy Yankee is making the rounds with Snow’s 1992 hit “Informer,” blessing his remake as “Con Calma” and featuring Snow himself.El General’s “Tu Pum Pum” is also a favorite among artists, with Karol G, Sammi Sanchez and Messiah all dropping their own version of the ‘90s Latin dancehall hit.
