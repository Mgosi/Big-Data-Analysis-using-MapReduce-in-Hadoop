Ozzy Osbourne is back to his normal routine after a recent health scare, and based on a video his son Jack posted, it looks like his granddaughters are keeping him in good spirits as well.     Jack's daughters -- Pearl, 6, and Andy, 3 -- are seen in the video singing along and dancing to Osbourne's classic hit "Crazy Train."
