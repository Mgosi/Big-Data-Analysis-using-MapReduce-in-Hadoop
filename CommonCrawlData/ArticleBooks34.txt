By Roger AngellApril 17, 2013In his engaging “Yellow Fever ,” this week, Adam Gopnik recalls himself as a child leafing through an accumulated stack of ancient, yellow-bordered National Geographic magazines in his grandparents’ house, but his thoughtful ensuing search for private connection and social consequence in those shiny pages somehow omits a famous prior Geo road marker: Elizabeth Bishop’s “In the Waiting Room.”In that remarkable 1971 poem, she is a child of six sitting in a dentist’s waiting room in Worcester, Massachusetts—her Aunt Consuelo is the patient in the chair within—and carefully studying the photographs in the same magazine:Osa and Martin Johnsondressed in riding breeches,laced boots, and pith helmets.A dead man slung on a pole—“Long Pig,” the caption said.Babies with pointed headswound round and round with string;black, naked women with neckswound round and round with wirelike the necks of light bulbs.Their breasts were horrifying.I read it right straight through.I was too shy to stop… .It is the latest issue, and, as she reads, it suddenly comes over her that she is herself:… you are an I.You are an Elizabeth.And then, at the end:… Outside,in Worcester, Massachusetts,were night and slush and cold,and it was still the fifthof February, 1918.Photograph, of Elizabeth Bishop, in 1956: Bettmann/Corbis.Roger Angell, a senior editor and a staff writer, has contributed to The New Yorker since 1944, and became a fiction editor in 1956.
