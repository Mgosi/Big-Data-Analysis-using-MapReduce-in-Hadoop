Subscribe To 5 Reveals DC Needs To Make At San Diego Comic-Con UpdatesIt's that time of year again, folks. San Diego Comic-Con is finally upon us, which means that it's time to start thinking about all of the latest and greatest news that's sure to break over the course of the next few days. Pretty much every major studio and superhero-centric giant will bring something different and exciting to the table, but one of the most interesting of the bunch is what Warner Bros. has planned for the DCEU when the annual event kicks off.While we're beyond excited to see what DC and Warner Bros. have in store for us when San Diego Comic-Con shifts into high gear, we still don't know too much about their exact plan. With that in mind, we have compiled a list of reveals that DC has to make at this year's SDCC. Take a look at these possibilities, and let us know what you want to see from Warner Bros. In the comments section below!This one really feels like the no-brainer of the bunch. If DC Entertainment goes to this year's San Diego Comic-Con and we walk away without a new full trailer for Zack Snyder's (or is it Joss Whedon's?) Justice League we'll be absolutely shocked, especially considering how little we have actually seen of it. With the film debuting in theaters in less than four months, and only one real trailer currently available online, all eyes are on the upcoming epic ensemble to deliver some brand new footage that will kick its marketing campaign into high gear. DC needs to make a statement with its first Justice League movie, and there's no better place to do so than San Diego Comic-Con.Following the release of Justice League, we are going to have a fairly substantial break from DC films until the release of James Wan's solo Aquaman movie on December 21, 2018. The project is currently shooting in Australia, and while we don't anticipate a full trailer to debut at San Diego Comic-Con, it seems incredibly feasible to assume that DC will bring some early footage to entice audiences. Aquaman is arguably the first DC film that will feel the full force of the major creative overhauls that have taken place following the overwhelmingly positive reception to Wonder Woman. If that's the case, then an early sizzle reel of Arthur Curry, Mera, Vulko, and the rest will undoubtedly help reinforce the idea that the DC ship is back on course.Over the course of the last few months, DC has announced a wave of new projects, all of which still need actors. With so many vibrant personas ready for action, we expect DC to come to the table with at least one surprise casting announcement for one of its upcoming projects. With Gotham City Sirens on the horizon, casting choices for Catwoman and Poison Ivy seems like obvious picks, and in the realm of Shazam, we still need to know who is stepping in as Billy Batson. Recent rumors have also suggested that Batgirl is on a fast track following the success of Wonder Woman, so it would also make plenty of sense for DC to show up in San Diego with a brand new Barbara Gordon as well.At this point, there are considerably more films on the DC slate than there are directors attached to said films.

It's that time of year again, folks. San Diego Comic-Con is finally upon us, which means that it's time to start thinking about all of the latest and greatest news that's sure to break over the course of the next few days. Pretty much every major studio and superhero-centric giant will bring something different and exciting to the table, but one of the most interesting of the bunch is what Warner Bros. has planned for the DCEU when the annual event kicks off.

While we're beyond excited to see what DC and Warner Bros. have in store for us when San Diego Comic-Con shifts into high gear, we still don't know too much about their exact plan. With that in mind, we have compiled a list of reveals that DC has to make at this year's SDCC. Take a look at these possibilities, and let us know what you want to see from Warner Bros. In the comments section below!

A New Justice League Trailer
This one really feels like the no-brainer of the bunch. If DC Entertainment goes to this year's San Diego Comic-Con and we walk away without a new full trailer for Zack Snyder's (or is it Joss Whedon's?) Justice League we'll be absolutely shocked, especially considering how little we have actually seen of it. With the film debuting in theaters in less than four months, and only one real trailer currently available online, all eyes are on the upcoming epic ensemble to deliver some brand new footage that will kick its marketing campaign into high gear. DC needs to make a statement with its first Justice League movie, and there's no better place to do so than San Diego Comic-Con.

An Early Look At Aquaman
Following the release of Justice League, we are going to have a fairly substantial break from DC films until the release of James Wan's solo Aquaman movie on December 21, 2018. The project is currently shooting in Australia, and while we don't anticipate a full trailer to debut at San Diego Comic-Con, it seems incredibly feasible to assume that DC will bring some early footage to entice audiences. Aquaman is arguably the first DC film that will feel the full force of the major creative overhauls that have taken place following the overwhelmingly positive reception to Wonder Woman. If that's the case, then an early sizzle reel of Arthur Curry, Mera, Vulko, and the rest will undoubtedly help reinforce the idea that the DC ship is back on course.

At Least One Major Casting Announcement
Over the course of the last few months, DC has announced a wave of new projects, all of which still need actors. With so many vibrant personas ready for action, we expect DC to come to the table with at least one surprise casting announcement for one of its upcoming projects. With Gotham City Sirens on the horizon, casting choices for Catwoman and Poison Ivy seems like obvious picks, and in the realm of Shazam, we still need to know who is stepping in as Billy Batson. Recent rumors have also suggested that Batgirl is on a fast track following the success of Wonder Woman, so it would also make plenty of sense for DC to show up in San Diego with a brand new Barbara Gordon as well.

A Director For An Established Project
At this point, there are considerably more films on the DC slate than there are directors attached to said films. With the studio making an effort to streamline its process and give us something more cohesive, it stands to reason that we will learn about at least one new director for one of these projects. There are plenty of movies to choose from, such as Shazam -- which has long been rumored to have its eye on Lights Out director David Sandberg.

A Definitive Release Schedule
Unlike Marvel Studios (and 20th Century Fox, to a lesser extent), DC Entertainment and Warner Bros. have opted to fly by the seat of their pants with regards to release dates and schedules. We don't really know what the definitive DC film slate actually looks like anymore, and the studio needs to use San Diego Comic-Con clear the air and let audiences know exactly what's coming. With movies like Cyborg currently floating in limbo, a concrete plan for how DC plans to roll out its films over the course of the next few years will go a long way towards assuaging fan concerns about the overall direction of the DC Extended Universe. A schedule is the backbone of a cinematic universe; it's time for us to see DC's.

It's that time of year again, folks. San Diego Comic-Con is finally upon us, which means that it's time to start thinking about all of the latest and greatest news that's sure to break over the course of the next few days. Pretty much every major studio and superhero-centric giant will bring something different and exciting to the table, but one of the most interesting of the bunch is what Warner Bros. has planned for the DCEU when the annual event kicks off.


(window._jsqueue=window._jsqueue||[]).push("a587c68b-6ba7-48a0-bc28-bfc6b95649a8");

While we're beyond excited to see what DC and Warner Bros. have in store for us when San Diego Comic-Con shifts into high gear, we still don't know too much about their exact plan. With that in mind, we have compiled a list of reveals that DC has to make at this year's SDCC. Take a look at these possibilities, and let us know what you want to see from Warner Bros. In the comments section below!

A New Justice League Trailer
This one really feels like the no-brainer of the bunch. If DC Entertainment goes to this year's San Diego Comic-Con and we walk away without a new full trailer for Zack Snyder's (or is it Joss Whedon's?) Justice League we'll be absolutely shocked, especially considering how little we have actually seen of it. With the film debuting in theaters in less than four months, and only one real trailer currently available online, all eyes are on the upcoming epic ensemble to deliver some brand new footage that will kick its marketing campaign into high gear. DC needs to make a statement with its first Justice League movie, and there's no better place to do so than San Diego Comic-Con.

(window._jsqueue=window._jsqueue||[]).push("ef851f19-0993-4744-a034-5fbd72310cdb");

An Early Look At Aquaman
Following the release of Justice League, we are going to have a fairly substantial break from DC films until the release of James Wan's solo Aquaman movie on December 21, 2018. The project is currently shooting in Australia, and while we don't anticipate a full trailer to debut at San Diego Comic-Con, it seems incredibly feasible to assume that DC will bring some early footage to entice audiences. Aquaman is arguably the first DC film that will feel the full force of the major creative overhauls that have taken place following the overwhelmingly positive reception to Wonder Woman. If that's the case, then an early sizzle reel of Arthur Curry, Mera, Vulko, and the rest will undoubtedly help reinforce the idea that the DC ship is back on course.

At Least One Major Casting Announcement
Over the course of the last few months, DC has announced a wave of new projects, all of which still need actors. With so many vibrant personas ready for action, we expect DC to come to the table with at least one surprise casting announcement for one of its upcoming projects. With Gotham City Sirens on the horizon, casting choices for Catwoman and Poison Ivy seems like obvious picks, and in the realm of Shazam, we still need to know who is stepping in as Billy Batson. Recent rumors have also suggested that Batgirl is on a fast track following the success of Wonder Woman, so it would also make plenty of sense for DC to show up in San Diego with a brand new Barbara Gordon as well.

A Director For An Established Project
At this point, there are considerably more films on the DC slate than there are directors attached to said films. With the studio making an effort to streamline its process and give us something more cohesive, it stands to reason that we will learn about at least one new director for one of these projects. There are plenty of movies to choose from, such as Shazam -- which has long been rumored to have its eye on Lights Out director David Sandberg. Beyond that, there's also the far off Green Lantern Corps movie (which we have long maintained should enlist the directing chops of Shane Black). DC films have never had any issue attracting talented filmmakers; now it's just a matter of locking them down for specific projects.

At Least One Major Casting Announcement
Over the course of the last few months, DC has announced a wave of new projects, all of which still need actors. With so many vibrant personas ready for action, we expect DC to come to the table with at least one surprise casting announcement for one of its upcoming projects. With Gotham City Sirens on the horizon, casting choices for Catwoman and Poison Ivy seems like obvious picks, and in the realm of Shazam, we still need to know who is stepping in as Billy Batson. Recent rumors have also suggested that Batgirl is on a fast track following the success of Wonder Woman, so it would also make plenty of sense for DC to show up in San Diego with a brand new Barbara Gordon as well.

A Director For An Established Project
At this point, there are considerably more films on the DC slate than there are directors attached to said films. With the studio making an effort to streamline its process and give us something more cohesive, it stands to reason that we will learn about at least one new director for one of these projects. There are plenty of movies to choose from, such as Shazam -- which has long been rumored to have its eye on Lights Out director David Sandberg. Beyond that, there's also the far off Green Lantern Corps movie (which we have long maintained should enlist the directing chops of Shane Black). DC films have never had any issue attracting talented filmmakers; now it's just a matter of locking them down for specific projects.

A Definitive Release Schedule
Unlike Marvel Studios (and 20th Century Fox, to a lesser extent), DC Entertainment and Warner Bros. have opted to fly by the seat of their pants with regards to release dates and schedules. We don't really know what the definitive DC film slate actually looks like anymore, and the studio needs to use San Diego Comic-Con clear the air and let audiences know exactly what's coming. With movies like Cyborg currently floating in limbo, a concrete plan for how DC plans to roll out its films over the course of the next few years will go a long way towards assuaging fan concerns about the overall direction of the DC Extended Universe. A schedule is the backbone of a cinematic universe; it's time for us to see DC's.
