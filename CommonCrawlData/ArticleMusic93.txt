Since its initial public offering in 2002, Netflix stock has surged 14,712%.
That makes it one of the very BEST performing stocks of the last 15 years. Now, the big gains for Netflix have already happened.
But the next “Netflix” is just ahead. This upcoming IPO is the “Netflix of music”  ̶  and you can BUY stock before the IPO. Watch this video right now for instructions.
Here’s the stock performance of Netflix over the last 15 years.

Now, I’m pretty familiar with Netflix. In fact, I bought the stock six years ago . . . and I’m currently sitting on HUGE 1,679% profits.
Netflix isn’t going to go up another 100% or 300% in the next year. But the “Netflix of music” could see its shares surge after the IPO.
Buying the Next Netflix
Netflix currently has nearly 100 million paying subscribers. Those members paid an average of $9.38 per month during the last quarter, generating $2.8 billion in revenues.
When it comes to online video, Netflix is king, crushing attempts by Apple, Amazon and other venture capital-funded startups.
In the music business, Spotify is the leading online music streaming service. It provides members with access to +3 million songs on demand, for less than $10 per month.
Spotify has 60 million paying subscribers, according to recent reports.  Plus, it has an additional 90 million members who use the service for free.
Buy BEFORE the Spotify IPO
The market capitalization of Netflix stands at $77.4 billion. That means each current subscriber is valued at $778.
Meanwhile, Spotify is currently valued at $13 billion. And indicates that  the stock market and investors are valuing each Spotify subscriber at just $217.
How’s it possible that Netflix is worth nearly 3x more, on a per-subscriber basis? It’s difficult to understand.
After all, Spotify members pay similar fees to Netflix members. Spotify has grown its paid membership from 50 to 60 million within the last three months. And music is a HUGE business.
Perhaps Netflix is more of a household name. Or it could be that there’s occasionally a big disconnect between pubic markets where Netflix trades, and private markets for companies like Spotify.
Once the Spotify IPO takes place, I’d expect the share price to more closely reflect the Netflix valuation.
Instead of a $13 billion market value on the private market, Spotify could be worth more than $37 billion if its subscribers were given the same value.
What’s the true value of the Spotify IPO? We won’t know until the company goes public. That’s when the markets will determine “fair value.”
This LIVE video reveals how to grab your stake ASAP.

Since its initial public offering in 2002, Netflix stock has surged 14,712%.
That makes it one of the very BEST performing stocks of the last 15 years. Now, the big gains for Netflix have already happened.
But the next “Netflix” is just ahead. This upcoming IPO is the “Netflix of music”  ̶  and you can BUY stock before the IPO. Watch this video right now for instructions.
Here’s the stock performance of Netflix over the last 15 years.

Now, I’m pretty familiar with Netflix. In fact, I bought the stock six years ago . . . and I’m currently sitting on HUGE 1,679% profits.
Netflix isn’t going to go up another 100% or 300% in the next year. But the “Netflix of music” could see its shares surge after the IPO.
Buying the Next Netflix
Netflix currently has nearly 100 million paying subscribers. Those members paid an average of $9.38 per month during the last quarter, generating $2.8 billion in revenues.
When it comes to online video, Netflix is king, crushing attempts by Apple, Amazon and other venture capital-funded startups.
In the music business, Spotify is the leading online music streaming service. It provides members with access to +3 million songs on demand, for less than $10 per month.
Spotify has 60 million paying subscribers, according to recent reports.  Plus, it has an additional 90 million members who use the service for free.
Buy BEFORE the Spotify IPO
The market capitalization of Netflix stands at $77.4 billion. That means each current subscriber is valued at $778.
Meanwhile, Spotify is currently valued at $13 billion. And indicates that  the stock market and investors are valuing each Spotify subscriber at just $217.
How’s it possible that Netflix is worth nearly 3x more, on a per-subscriber basis? It’s difficult to understand.
After all, Spotify members pay similar fees to Netflix members. Spotify has grown its paid membership from 50 to 60 million within the last three months. And music is a HUGE business.
Perhaps Netflix is more of a household name. Or it could be that there’s occasionally a big disconnect between pubic markets where Netflix trades, and private markets for companies like Spotify.
Once the Spotify IPO takes place, I’d expect the share price to more closely reflect the Netflix valuation.
Instead of a $13 billion market value on the private market, Spotify could be worth more than $37 billion if its subscribers were given the same value.
What’s the true value of the Spotify IPO? We won’t know until the company goes public. That’s when the markets will determine “fair value.”
This LIVE video reveals how to grab your stake ASAP.
The video is online for a couple hours . . . and it’s going OFFLINE tonight at midnight.
Right now, you can access dozens of A+ privately held companies, including Spotify, Dropbox, Lyft and Palantir. Plus, you can get in BEFORE the IPO.
