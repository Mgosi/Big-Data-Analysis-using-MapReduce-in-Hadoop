Just a few weeks ago, Firefly alums Alan Tudyk and Nathan Fillion put together an awesome viral campaign to jumpstart a new TV project called Con Man. The campaign was incredibly successful, and Con Man is already moving forward. Now, Tudyk has revealed that he would eventually like to see all of the main Firefly cast members return to the show for roles.

 Everybody has committed to being in Con Man. I don't want to waste their cameos. So, I'm hoping for a second season to put them all in. Right now, it's just Sean and Gina in the first season. Possibly more. The others will be Where's Waldo? type cameos. 

So, the great news is that Alan Tudyk has already talked to the major members of the Firefly cast, which include Gina Torres, Morena Baccarin, Sean Maher, Adam Baldwin, Summer Glau, Jewel Staite and Ron Glass. The extra good news, according to Tudyk's AMA, is that Tudyk and Fillion are going to star in Con Man, and Torres and Maher have already signed on for roles in the new webseries. For now, it seems the others will be around in some background form, but will not have real roles. So, Tudyk seems to be hoping to prove the concept is a big enough success that more money can be raised for a second season and more big guest stints or roles can be assigned to the former Firefly crew.

Honestly, Con Man would be the perfect fit for a Firefly reunion. The new webseries is all about Wray Nerely and Jack Moore (Tudyk and Fillion), who were actors on a beloved science fiction series called Spectrum which was cancelled too soon but later gained a cult following. The title is short for “Convention Man,” but obviously that would be less cool. With the cheeky premise in mind, it’s no surprise that Con Man might want to nod at popular science fiction references, TV shows and actors. It’s very reminiscent of the times Fillion and co. have nodded at Firefly in his ABC drama, Castle.



In addition to the Firefly alums, a bunch of other well-known actors and actresses associated with Syfy gigs have also signed on. This includes Battlestar Galactica alums Tricia Helfer and Michael Trucco and The Walking Dead’s Emily Kinney, whose final episode on the AMC zombie drama was a hot topic during the midwinter finale this year.

Thanks to a great Indiegogo campaign, Con Man is definitely moving forward. We’ll let you know when it gets a premiere date. In the meantime, you can check out Alan Tudyk's entire Reddit AMA.

Just a few weeks ago, Firefly alums Alan Tudyk and Nathan Fillion put together an awesome viral campaign to jumpstart a new TV project called Con Man. The campaign was incredibly successful, and Con Man is already moving forward. Now, Tudyk has revealed that he would eventually like to see all of the main Firefly cast members return to the show for roles.

 Everybody has committed to being in Con Man. I don't want to waste their cameos. So, I'm hoping for a second season to put them all in. Right now, it's just Sean and Gina in the first season. Possibly more. The others will be Where's Waldo? type cameos. 

So, the great news is that Alan Tudyk has already talked to the major members of the Firefly cast, which include Gina Torres, Morena Baccarin, Sean Maher, Adam Baldwin, Summer Glau, Jewel Staite and Ron Glass. The extra good news, according to Tudyk's AMA, is that Tudyk and Fillion are going to star in Con Man, and Torres and Maher have already signed on for roles in the new webseries. For now, it seems the others will be around in some background form, but will not have real roles. So, Tudyk seems to be hoping to prove the concept is a big enough success that more money can be raised for a second season and more big guest stints or roles can be assigned to the former Firefly crew.

Honestly, Con Man would be the perfect fit for a Firefly reunion. The new webseries is all about Wray Nerely and Jack Moore (Tudyk and Fillion), who were actors on a beloved science fiction series called Spectrum which was cancelled too soon but later gained a cult following. The title is short for “Convention Man,” but obviously that would be less cool. With the cheeky premise in mind, it’s no surprise that Con Man might want to nod at popular science fiction references, TV shows and actors. It’s very reminiscent of the times Fillion and co. have nodded at Firefly in his ABC drama, Castle.



In addition to the Firefly alums, a bunch of other well-known actors and actresses associated with Syfy gigs have also signed on. This includes Battlestar Galactica alums Tricia Helfer and Michael Trucco and The Walking Dead’s Emily Kinney, whose final episode on the AMC zombie drama was a hot topic during the midwinter finale this year.

Thanks to a great Indiegogo campaign, Con Man is definitely moving forward. We’ll let you know when it gets a premiere date. In the meantime, you can check out Alan Tudyk's entire Reddit AMA.

Alan Tudyk Wants The Full Firefly Cast On His New Series Con Man




Alan Tudyk Wants The Full Firefly Cast On His New Series Con Man

Just a few weeks ago, Firefly alums Alan Tudyk and Nathan Fillion put together an awesome viral campaign to jumpstart a new TV project called Con Man. The campaign was incredibly successful, and Con Man is already moving forward. Now, Tudyk has revealed that he would eventually like to see all of the main Firefly cast members return to the show for roles.

 Everybody has committed to being in Con Man. I don't want to waste their cameos. So, I'm hoping for a second season to put them all in. Right now, it's just Sean and Gina in the first season. Possibly more. The others will be Where's Waldo? type cameos. 

So, the great news is that Alan Tudyk has already talked to the major members of the Firefly cast, which include Gina Torres, Morena Baccarin, Sean Maher, Adam Baldwin, Summer Glau, Jewel Staite and Ron Glass. The extra good news, according to Tudyk's AMA, is that Tudyk and Fillion are going to star in Con Man, and Torres and Maher have already signed on for roles in the new webseries. For now, it seems the others will be around in some background form, but will not have real roles. So, Tudyk seems to be hoping to prove the concept is a big enough success that more money can be raised for a second season and more big guest stints or roles can be assigned to the former Firefly crew.

Honestly, Con Man would be the perfect fit for a Firefly reunion. The new webseries is all about Wray Nerely and Jack Moore (Tudyk and Fillion), who were actors on a beloved science fiction series called Spectrum which was cancelled too soon but later gained a cult following. The title is short for “Convention Man,” but obviously that would be less cool. With the cheeky premise in mind, it’s no surprise that Con Man might want to nod at popular science fiction references, TV shows and actors. It’s very reminiscent of the times Fillion and co. have nodded at Firefly in his ABC drama, Castle.



In addition to the Firefly alums, a bunch of other well-known actors and actresses associated with Syfy gigs have also signed on. This includes Battlestar Galactica alums Tricia Helfer and Michael Trucco and The Walking Dead’s Emily Kinney, whose final episode on the AMC zombie drama was a hot topic during the midwinter finale this year.

Thanks to a great Indiegogo campaign, Con Man is definitely moving forward. We’ll let you know when it gets a premiere date. In the meantime, you can check out Alan Tudyk's entire Reddit AMA.
