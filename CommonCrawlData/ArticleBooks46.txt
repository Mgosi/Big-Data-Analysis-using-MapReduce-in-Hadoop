By Tobias WolffMay 28, 2017Denis Johnson, pictured in 2008, had one of the most distinctive voices in American literature.Denis and I became friends in the late seventies, when we were both living in Phoenix, a city that neither of us loved. Taking refuge from the heat and the faux-cowboy, arms-bearing culture, we got together to talk about books and writing and the prisoners we sometimes worked with at the state penitentiary in Florence. Both of us in need of some spiritual footing, we now and then accompanied each other to church. Denis was coming out of a troubled chapter in his life—an imaginative version of which he was to create, indelibly, in “Jesus’ Son,” and, more obliquely, in other works—and supporting himself, he told me, by renting out his uncanny typing skills at a high premium to local agencies and businesses that needed rush jobs on contracts and applications. Common friends who had known him at Iowa told me that he had enjoyed a certain renown there for his speed on the keys, and that other young writers, approaching deadlines, often hired him to type up their stories for workshop, and even entire theses.Denis, who died this week at the age of sixty-seven, was resolutely sober, abstemious, but not at all grave. He had a boyish, even impish quality that had not deserted him when I saw him last, some five or six years ago, here at Stanford. His humor was mordant, with a refined sense of the absurd, but never cruel. He had already come too close to disaster in this “parched world,” as he describes it in his poem “Nude,” to take pleasure in the struggles of others. But he had a sharp eye for the illusions and evasions and self-deceptions that lead us into absurdity, and this informed the essential generosity of his work.From Phoenix we went our separate ways, and met only occasionally in the years that followed, but I have always felt close to Denis through reading his work. I need hardly say that his is one of the most distinctive voices in our literature, and that he has written work that will abide—“Angels,” “Fiskadoro,” “The Incognito Lounge,” “Jesus’ Son,” and more_._ That voice, though—the inventiveness and exactitude and dark underlying wit, sometimes flowering into startling bloom, as when the mad, drug-addled orderly Georgie, in the short story “Emergency,” having been asked what he does, replies, “I save lives.”Dive into the world of literature with The New Yorker’s weekly fiction newsletter.By Ben TaubBy Mike SpiesBy Susan B.

Taking refuge from the heat and the faux-cowboy, arms-bearing culture, we got together to talk about books and writing and the prisoners we sometimes worked with at the state penitentiary in Florence. Both of us in need of some spiritual footing, we now and then accompanied each other to church. Denis was coming out of a troubled chapter in his life—an imaginative version of which he was to create, indelibly, in “Jesus’ Son,” and, more obliquely, in other works—and supporting himself, he told me, by renting out his uncanny typing skills at a high premium to local agencies and businesses that needed rush jobs on contracts and applications. Common friends who had known him at Iowa told me that he had enjoyed a certain renown there for his speed on the keys, and that other young writers, approaching deadlines, often hired him to type up their stories for workshop, and even entire theses.Denis, who died this week at the age of sixty-seven, was resolutely sober, abstemious, but not at all grave. He had a boyish, even impish quality that had not deserted him when I saw him last, some five or six years ago, here at Stanford. His humor was mordant, with a refined sense of the absurd, but never cruel. He had already come too close to disaster in this “parched world,” as he describes it in his poem “Nude,” to take pleasure in the struggles of others. But he had a sharp eye for the illusions and evasions and self-deceptions that lead us into absurdity, and this informed the essential generosity of his work.From Phoenix we went our separate ways, and met only occasionally in the years that followed, but I have always felt close to Denis through reading his work. I need hardly say that his is one of the most distinctive voices in our literature, and that he has written work that will abide—“Angels,” “Fiskadoro,” “The Incognito Lounge,” “Jesus’ Son,” and more_._ That voice, though—the inventiveness and exactitude and dark underlying wit, sometimes flowering into startling bloom, as when the mad, drug-addled orderly Georgie, in the short story “Emergency,” having been asked what he does, replies, “I save lives.”Dive into the world of literature with The New Yorker’s weekly fiction newsletter.SubmitSubmitMost Popular1.A Reporter at LargeGuantánamo’s Darkest SecretBy Ben Taub2.News DeskSecrecy, Self-Dealing, and Greed at the N.R.A.By Mike Spies3.Letter from Trump’s WashingtonThe Mueller Report Won’t End Trump’s Presidency, But It Sure Makes Him Look BadBy Susan B.
