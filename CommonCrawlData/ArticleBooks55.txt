Americans have a curiously limited vision of France. We may be wild about Chanel sunglasses, Vuitton handbags, Champagne or Paris in the spring, but when it comes to the kinds of contemporary French culture that can’t be bought in a duty-free shop, most of us draw a blank. Luckily, this veil of benign ignorance is being lifted as publishers in the United States introduce American readers to a new generation of hugely gifted French writers who are reworking the boundaries of fiction, memoir and history (Emmanuel Carrère, Laurent Binet, the American-born Jonathan Littell) or of high art and snuff lit (Michel Houelle­becq). Among the recent crop of writers just reaching the top of their game, Marie NDiaye, born in 1967 and now living in Berlin, is pre-eminent.NDiaye’s career has been stellar. When she was 18, the legendary editor Jérôme Lindon (best known as Samuel Beckett’s champion) published her first novel to high critical acclaim. Her subsequent fiction and plays have won numerous prizes and distinctions. (NDiaye’s “Papa Doit Manger,” or “Daddy’s Got to Eat,” produced in 2003, is one of the rare plays by a living woman to have entered the repertory of the ­Comédie-Française.) “Three Strong Women” — NDiaye’s most recent novel — won the Prix Goncourt when it appeared in 2009 and made her, according to a survey by L’Express-RTL, the most widely read French author of the year.That same year, NDiaye was the inadvertent cause of a national furor when a member of the French Parliament, responding to an interview in which she’d called the Sarkozy government “monstrous,” suggested in an open letter to the culture minister that Goncourt laureates should be required to “respect national cohesion and the image of our country” or else remain silent. What most disturbed people about this outburst — coupled as it was with the Sarkozy government’s increasingly ham-­fisted policies on inner-city policing and the expulsion of immigrants — was what they saw as its unspoken assumption that as a black woman of African parentage, NDiaye should have to prove herself deserving in a way that would never be demanded of white male laureates.The expectation — whether menacing or well meaning — that NDiaye should “represent” multiracial France, or be considered a voice of the French African diaspora, has often dogged her. In fact, as NDiaye is at pains to make clear, she scarcely knew her Senegalese father, who came to France as a student in the 1960s and returned to Africa when she was a baby. Raised by her French mother — a secondary school science teacher — in a housing project in suburban Paris, with vacations in the countryside where her maternal grandparents were farmers, NDiaye describes herself as a purely French product, with no claim to biculturalism but her surname and the color of her skin. Nonetheless, the absent father — charismatic, casually cruel, voraciously selfish — haunts NDiaye’s fiction and drama, as does the shadow of a dreamlike Africa in which demons and evil portents abound, where the unscrupulous can make overnight fortunes and, with another turn of the wheel, find themselves rotting in a jail cell.In “Three Strong Women,” these recurring themes have become more explicit. The novel consists of three loosely linked narratives. In the first, Norah, a lawyer raised in France by a single mother, is summoned to Dakar by her Senegalese father, only to find that the cool, elegant, self-made millionaire of her youth is now a broken-down old slob who wants her to untangle the murderous family mess he has gotten himself into. In the final section, we follow the fortunes of Khady Demba, whom we first encountered as a nursemaid caring for Norah’s father’s most recent batch of children. Khady, now a childless widow who has been cast out by her late husband’s family, finds herself joining the thousand-mile death march of clandestine migrants seeking to reach European shores.AdvertisementIt is, however, the book’s middle novella — a masterpiece of narrative ingenuity and emotional extremes — that proves NDiaye to be a writer of the highest caliber. Rudy, a middle-aged former high school teacher, has brought his Senegalese wife and their young son home from their idyllic life in Dakar to the French provinces, where he is now eking out a precarious living selling customized kitchens to people who can’t afford them. At first glance, Rudy — with his crummy hand-me-down car and the heavy mortgage on his “sad little half-done-up house”; with his itching hemorrhoids and his smooth-talking boss who may or may not be sleeping with Rudy’s wife — suggests the hapless hero of a Raymond Carver story. But as we’re sucked into the downward spiral of Rudy’s workday and gradually learn more about the sinister sequence of events that drove him from Senegal, we realize that we have entered the head of a paranoiac worthy of Dostoyevsky’s Underground Man or one of Thomas Bernhard’s embittered monomaniacs — a protagonist in whom successive waves of grandiosity, self-­lacerating shame and homicidal rage give way to heartbreaking instances of clarity and of compassion for the wife he has betrayed.AdvertisementThe novel’s original title, which might more literally be translated as “Three Powerful Women,” contains a gentle irony that’s lost in the English version. NDiaye’s heroines are, on the face of it, singularly powerless — not only were these women raised in poverty, each, “after years of austerely constructing an honorable existence” for herself, is in the process of having that life ripped apart by the folly of narcissistic family members. And yet, NDiaye shows us, each woman retains a saving core of humanity — an indestructible reserve of love, common sense or even self-mockery — that’s incomprehensible to the fathers, husbands or in-laws who are putting them at risk.NDiaye is a hypnotic storyteller with an unflinching understanding of the rock-bottom reality of most people’s lives. This clearsightedness — combined with her subtle narrative sleights of hand and her willingness to broach essential subjects like the fate of would-be migrants to the rich North — gives her fiction a rare integrity that shines through the sinuous prose. (Slightly less sinuous in John Fletcher’s occasionally stilted translation, which is a little too slow to warm up: the book’s only flaw.) In “Three Strong Women,” we enter the consciousness of characters who are either bordering on lunacy or at the mercy of the clearly delusional — or who, in the case of the unschooled slum-­dweller Khady Demba, find themselves hard-pressed to interpret the hellish circumstances into which they have been thrown. Yet through these distorting lenses of madness and deprivation, NDiaye manages nonetheless to convey a redemptive realism about how the world works, and what makes people tick — whether it’s a provincial businessman whose success lies in persuading his customers that the kitchen he’s selling is just an incidental expression of his warm personal regard for them; or the resentful French widow who always finds the neighbors’ children more attractive than her own; or a refugee who, robbed by border guards of all his savings, realizes that to make it through the desert to Europe’s promised land, he’s going to have to prostitute the woman he has vowed to protect.“Three Strong Women” is the poised creation of a novelist unafraid to explore the extremes of human suffering.THREE STRONG WOMENBy Marie NDiayeTranslated by John Fletcher293 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $25.95.An earlier version of this review erroneously attributed a distinction to Marie NDiaye’s play “Papa Doit Manger,” or “Daddy’s Got to Eat.” It is not the only play by a living woman to have entered the repertory of the ­Comédie-Française — another is "One Flea Spare," by Naomi Wallace, which became part of the repertory in May.Fernanda Eberstadt is the author of “Little Money Street,” an exploration of Gypsy culture in the South of France.A version of this review appears in print on August 12, 2012, on Page BR1 of the Sunday Book Review with the headline: Hopes Spring Eternal.

In “Three Strong Women,” these recurring themes have become more explicit. The novel consists of three loosely linked narratives. In the first, Norah, a lawyer raised in France by a single mother, is summoned to Dakar by her Senegalese father, only to find that the cool, elegant, self-made millionaire of her youth is now a broken-down old slob who wants her to untangle the murderous family mess he has gotten himself into. In the final section, we follow the fortunes of Khady Demba, whom we first encountered as a nursemaid caring for Norah’s father’s most recent batch of children. Khady, now a childless widow who has been cast out by her late husband’s family, finds herself joining the thousand-mile death march of clandestine migrants seeking to reach European shores.

It is, however, the book’s middle novella — a masterpiece of narrative ingenuity and emotional extremes — that proves NDiaye to be a writer of the highest caliber. Rudy, a middle-aged former high school teacher, has brought his Senegalese wife and their young son home from their idyllic life in Dakar to the French provinces, where he is now eking out a precarious living selling customized kitchens to people who can’t afford them.

But as we’re sucked into the downward spiral of Rudy’s workday and gradually learn more about the sinister sequence of events that drove him from Senegal, we realize that we have entered the head of a paranoiac worthy of Dostoyevsky’s Underground Man or one of Thomas Bernhard’s embittered monomaniacs — a protagonist in whom successive waves of grandiosity, self-­lacerating shame and homicidal rage give way to heartbreaking instances of clarity and of compassion for the wife he has betrayed.

THREE STRONG WOMEN
By Marie NDiaye
Translated by John Fletcher
293 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $25.95.




 Correction: October 28, 2012  
An earlier version of this review erroneously attributed a distinction to Marie NDiaye’s play “Papa Doit Manger,” or “Daddy’s Got to Eat.” It is not the only play by a living woman to have entered the repertory of the ­Comédie-Française — another is "One Flea Spare," by Naomi Wallace, which became part of the repertory in May. 



Fernanda Eberstadt is the author of “Little Money Street,” an exploration of Gypsy culture in the South of France.

Americans have a curiously limited vision of France. We may be wild about Chanel sunglasses, Vuitton handbags, Champagne or Paris in the spring, but when it comes to the kinds of contemporary French culture that can’t be bought in a duty-free shop, most of us draw a blank. Luckily, this veil of benign ignorance is being lifted as publishers in the United States introduce American readers to a new generation of hugely gifted French writers who are reworking the boundaries of fiction, memoir and history (Emmanuel Carrère, Laurent Binet, the American-born Jonathan Littell) or of high art and snuff lit (Michel Houelle­becq). Among the recent crop of writers just reaching the top of their game, Marie NDiaye, born in 1967 and now living in Berlin, is pre-eminent.NDiaye’s career has been stellar. When she was 18, the legendary editor Jérôme Lindon (best known as Samuel Beckett’s champion) published her first novel to high critical acclaim. Her subsequent fiction and plays have won numerous prizes and distinctions. (NDiaye’s “Papa Doit Manger,” or “Daddy’s Got to Eat,” produced in 2003, is one of the rare plays by a living woman to have entered the repertory of the ­Comédie-Française.) “Three Strong Women” — NDiaye’s most recent novel — won the Prix Goncourt when it appeared in 2009 and made her, according to a survey by L’Express-RTL, the most widely read French author of the year.That same year, NDiaye was the inadvertent cause of a national furor when a member of the French Parliament, responding to an interview in which she’d called the Sarkozy government “monstrous,” suggested in an open letter to the culture minister that Goncourt laureates should be required to “respect national cohesion and the image of our country” or else remain silent. What most disturbed people about this outburst — coupled as it was with the Sarkozy government’s increasingly ham-­fisted policies on inner-city policing and the expulsion of immigrants — was what they saw as its unspoken assumption that as a black woman of African parentage, NDiaye should have to prove herself deserving in a way that would never be demanded of white male laureates.The expectation — whether menacing or well meaning — that NDiaye should “represent” multiracial France, or be considered a voice of the French African diaspora, has often dogged her. In fact, as NDiaye is at pains to make clear, she scarcely knew her Senegalese father, who came to France as a student in the 1960s and returned to Africa when she was a baby. Raised by her French mother — a secondary school science teacher — in a housing project in suburban Paris, with vacations in the countryside where her maternal grandparents were farmers, NDiaye describes herself as a purely French product, with no claim to biculturalism but her surname and the color of her skin. Nonetheless, the absent father — charismatic, casually cruel, voraciously selfish — haunts NDiaye’s fiction and drama, as does the shadow of a dreamlike Africa in which demons and evil portents abound, where the unscrupulous can make overnight fortunes and, with another turn of the wheel, find themselves rotting in a jail cell.

In “Three Strong Women,” these recurring themes have become more explicit. The novel consists of three loosely linked narratives. In the first, Norah, a lawyer raised in France by a single mother, is summoned to Dakar by her Senegalese father, only to find that the cool, elegant, self-made millionaire of her youth is now a broken-down old slob who wants her to untangle the murderous family mess he has gotten himself into. In the final section, we follow the fortunes of Khady Demba, whom we first encountered as a nursemaid caring for Norah’s father’s most recent batch of children. Khady, now a childless widow who has been cast out by her late husband’s family, finds herself joining the thousand-mile death march of clandestine migrants seeking to reach European shores.

It is, however, the book’s middle novella — a masterpiece of narrative ingenuity and emotional extremes — that proves NDiaye to be a writer of the highest caliber. Rudy, a middle-aged former high school teacher, has brought his Senegalese wife and their young son home from their idyllic life in Dakar to the French provinces, where he is now eking out a precarious living selling customized kitchens to people who can’t afford them. At first glance, Rudy — with his crummy hand-me-down car and the heavy mortgage on his “sad little half-done-up house”; with his itching hemorrhoids and his smooth-talking boss who may or may not be sleeping with Rudy’s wife — suggests the hapless hero of a Raymond Carver story. But as we’re sucked into the downward spiral of Rudy’s workday and gradually learn more about the sinister sequence of events that drove him from Senegal, we realize that we have entered the head of a paranoiac worthy of Dostoyevsky’s Underground Man or one of Thomas Bernhard’s embittered monomaniacs — a protagonist in whom successive waves of grandiosity, self-­lacerating shame and homicidal rage give way to heartbreaking instances of clarity and of compassion for the wife he has betrayed.

The novel’s original title, which might more literally be translated as “Three Powerful Women,” contains a gentle irony that’s lost in the English version. NDiaye’s heroines are, on the face of it, singularly powerless — not only were these women raised in poverty, each, “after years of austerely constructing an honorable existence” for herself, is in the process of having that life ripped apart by the folly of narcissistic family members. And yet, NDiaye shows us, each woman retains a saving core of humanity — an indestructible reserve of love, common sense or even self-mockery — that’s incomprehensible to the fathers, husbands or in-laws who are putting them at risk.NDiaye is a hypnotic storyteller with an unflinching understanding of the rock-bottom reality of most people’s lives. This clearsightedness — combined with her subtle narrative sleights of hand and her willingness to broach essential subjects like the fate of would-be migrants to the rich North — gives her fiction a rare integrity that shines through the sinuous prose. (Slightly less sinuous in John Fletcher’s occasionally stilted translation, which is a little too slow to warm up: the book’s only flaw.) In “Three Strong Women,” we enter the consciousness of characters who are either bordering on lunacy or at the mercy of the clearly delusional — or who, in the case of the unschooled slum-­dweller Khady Demba, find themselves hard-pressed to interpret the hellish circumstances into which they have been thrown. Yet through these distorting lenses of madness and deprivation, NDiaye manages nonetheless to convey a redemptive realism about how the world works, and what makes people tick — whether it’s a provincial businessman whose success lies in persuading his customers that the kitchen he’s selling is just an incidental expression of his warm personal regard for them; or the resentful French widow who always finds the neighbors’ children more attractive than her own; or a refugee who, robbed by border guards of all his savings, realizes that to make it through the desert to Europe’s promised land, he’s going to have to prostitute the woman he has vowed to protect.“Three Strong Women” is the poised creation of a novelist unafraid to explore the extremes of human suffering.

 Correction: October 28, 2012  
An earlier version of this review erroneously attributed a distinction to Marie NDiaye’s play “Papa Doit Manger,” or “Daddy’s Got to Eat.” It is not the only play by a living woman to have entered the repertory of the ­Comédie-Française — another is "One Flea Spare," by Naomi Wallace, which became part of the repertory in May. 



Fernanda Eberstadt is the author of “Little Money Street,” an exploration of Gypsy culture in the South of France.

Americans have a curiously limited vision of France. We may be wild about Chanel sunglasses, Vuitton handbags, Champagne or Paris in the spring, but when it comes to the kinds of contemporary French culture that can’t be bought in a duty-free shop, most of us draw a blank. Luckily, this veil of benign ignorance is being lifted as publishers in the United States introduce American readers to a new generation of hugely gifted French writers who are reworking the boundaries of fiction, memoir and history (Emmanuel Carrère, Laurent Binet, the American-born Jonathan Littell) or of high art and snuff lit (Michel Houelle­becq). Among the recent crop of writers just reaching the top of their game, Marie NDiaye, born in 1967 and now living in Berlin, is pre-eminent.NDiaye’s career has been stellar. When she was 18, the legendary editor Jérôme Lindon (best known as Samuel Beckett’s champion) published her first novel to high critical acclaim. Her subsequent fiction and plays have won numerous prizes and distinctions. (NDiaye’s “Papa Doit Manger,” or “Daddy’s Got to Eat,” produced in 2003, is one of the rare plays by a living woman to have entered the repertory of the ­Comédie-Française.) “Three Strong Women” — NDiaye’s most recent novel — won the Prix Goncourt when it appeared in 2009 and made her, according to a survey by L’Express-RTL, the most widely read French author of the year.That same year, NDiaye was the inadvertent cause of a national furor when a member of the French Parliament, responding to an interview in which she’d called the Sarkozy government “monstrous,” suggested in an open letter to the culture minister that Goncourt laureates should be required to “respect national cohesion and the image of our country” or else remain silent. What most disturbed people about this outburst — coupled as it was with the Sarkozy government’s increasingly ham-­fisted policies on inner-city policing and the expulsion of immigrants — was what they saw as its unspoken assumption that as a black woman of African parentage, NDiaye should have to prove herself deserving in a way that would never be demanded of white male laureates.The expectation — whether menacing or well meaning — that NDiaye should “represent” multiracial France, or be considered a voice of the French African diaspora, has often dogged her. In fact, as NDiaye is at pains to make clear, she scarcely knew her Senegalese father, who came to France as a student in the 1960s and returned to Africa when she was a baby. Raised by her French mother — a secondary school science teacher — in a housing project in suburban Paris, with vacations in the countryside where her maternal grandparents were farmers, NDiaye describes herself as a purely French product, with no claim to biculturalism but her surname and the color of her skin. Nonetheless, the absent father — charismatic, casually cruel, voraciously selfish — haunts NDiaye’s fiction and drama, as does the shadow of a dreamlike Africa in which demons and evil portents abound, where the unscrupulous can make overnight fortunes and, with another turn of the wheel, find themselves rotting in a jail cell.

In “Three Strong Women,” these recurring themes have become more explicit. The novel consists of three loosely linked narratives. In the first, Norah, a lawyer raised in France by a single mother, is summoned to Dakar by her Senegalese father, only to find that the cool, elegant, self-made millionaire of her youth is now a broken-down old slob who wants her to untangle the murderous family mess he has gotten himself into. In the final section, we follow the fortunes of Khady Demba, whom we first encountered as a nursemaid caring for Norah’s father’s most recent batch of children. Khady, now a childless widow who has been cast out by her late husband’s family, finds herself joining the thousand-mile death march of clandestine migrants seeking to reach European shores.

It is, however, the book’s middle novella — a masterpiece of narrative ingenuity and emotional extremes — that proves NDiaye to be a writer of the highest caliber. Rudy, a middle-aged former high school teacher, has brought his Senegalese wife and their young son home from their idyllic life in Dakar to the French provinces, where he is now eking out a precarious living selling customized kitchens to people who can’t afford them. At first glance, Rudy — with his crummy hand-me-down car and the heavy mortgage on his “sad little half-done-up house”; with his itching hemorrhoids and his smooth-talking boss who may or may not be sleeping with Rudy’s wife — suggests the hapless hero of a Raymond Carver story. But as we’re sucked into the downward spiral of Rudy’s workday and gradually learn more about the sinister sequence of events that drove him from Senegal, we realize that we have entered the head of a paranoiac worthy of Dostoyevsky’s Underground Man or one of Thomas Bernhard’s embittered monomaniacs — a protagonist in whom successive waves of grandiosity, self-­lacerating shame and homicidal rage give way to heartbreaking instances of clarity and of compassion for the wife he has betrayed.

Americans have a curiously limited vision of France. We may be wild about Chanel sunglasses, Vuitton handbags, Champagne or Paris in the spring, but when it comes to the kinds of contemporary French culture that can’t be bought in a duty-free shop, most of us draw a blank. Luckily, this veil of benign ignorance is being lifted as publishers in the United States introduce American readers to a new generation of hugely gifted French writers who are reworking the boundaries of fiction, memoir and history (Emmanuel Carrère, Laurent Binet, the American-born Jonathan Littell) or of high art and snuff lit (Michel Houelle­becq). Among the recent crop of writers just reaching the top of their game, Marie NDiaye, born in 1967 and now living in Berlin, is pre-eminent.NDiaye’s career has been stellar. When she was 18, the legendary editor Jérôme Lindon (best known as Samuel Beckett’s champion) published her first novel to high critical acclaim. Her subsequent fiction and plays have won numerous prizes and distinctions. (NDiaye’s “Papa Doit Manger,” or “Daddy’s Got to Eat,” produced in 2003, is one of the rare plays by a living woman to have entered the repertory of the ­Comédie-Française.) “Three Strong Women” — NDiaye’s most recent novel — won the Prix Goncourt when it appeared in 2009 and made her, according to a survey by L’Express-RTL, the most widely read French author of the year.That same year, NDiaye was the inadvertent cause of a national furor when a member of the French Parliament, responding to an interview in which she’d called the Sarkozy government “monstrous,” suggested in an open letter to the culture minister that Goncourt laureates should be required to “respect national cohesion and the image of our country” or else remain silent. What most disturbed people about this outburst — coupled as it was with the Sarkozy government’s increasingly ham-­fisted policies on inner-city policing and the expulsion of immigrants — was what they saw as its unspoken assumption that as a black woman of African parentage, NDiaye should have to prove herself deserving in a way that would never be demanded of white male laureates.The expectation — whether menacing or well meaning — that NDiaye should “represent” multiracial France, or be considered a voice of the French African diaspora, has often dogged her. In fact, as NDiaye is at pains to make clear, she scarcely knew her Senegalese father, who came to France as a student in the 1960s and returned to Africa when she was a baby. Raised by her French mother — a secondary school science teacher — in a housing project in suburban Paris, with vacations in the countryside where her maternal grandparents were farmers, NDiaye describes herself as a purely French product, with no claim to biculturalism but her surname and the color of her skin. Nonetheless, the absent father — charismatic, casually cruel, voraciously selfish — haunts NDiaye’s fiction and drama, as does the shadow of a dreamlike Africa in which demons and evil portents abound, where the unscrupulous can make overnight fortunes and, with another turn of the wheel, find themselves rotting in a jail cell.

The novel’s original title, which might more literally be translated as “Three Powerful Women,” contains a gentle irony that’s lost in the English version. NDiaye’s heroines are, on the face of it, singularly powerless — not only were these women raised in poverty, each, “after years of austerely constructing an honorable existence” for herself, is in the process of having that life ripped apart by the folly of narcissistic family members. And yet, NDiaye shows us, each woman retains a saving core of humanity — an indestructible reserve of love, common sense or even self-mockery — that’s incomprehensible to the fathers, husbands or in-laws who are putting them at risk.NDiaye is a hypnotic storyteller with an unflinching understanding of the rock-bottom reality of most people’s lives. This clearsightedness — combined with her subtle narrative sleights of hand and her willingness to broach essential subjects like the fate of would-be migrants to the rich North — gives her fiction a rare integrity that shines through the sinuous prose. (Slightly less sinuous in John Fletcher’s occasionally stilted translation, which is a little too slow to warm up: the book’s only flaw.) In “Three Strong Women,” we enter the consciousness of characters who are either bordering on lunacy or at the mercy of the clearly delusional — or who, in the case of the unschooled slum-­dweller Khady Demba, find themselves hard-pressed to interpret the hellish circumstances into which they have been thrown. Yet through these distorting lenses of madness and deprivation, NDiaye manages nonetheless to convey a redemptive realism about how the world works, and what makes people tick — whether it’s a provincial businessman whose success lies in persuading his customers that the kitchen he’s selling is just an incidental expression of his warm personal regard for them; or the resentful French widow who always finds the neighbors’ children more attractive than her own; or a refugee who, robbed by border guards of all his savings, realizes that to make it through the desert to Europe’s promised land, he’s going to have to prostitute the woman he has vowed to protect.“Three Strong Women” is the poised creation of a novelist unafraid to explore the extremes of human suffering.
