The Walking Dead may have existed solely as a comic book at one time, but those days are long gone, with Robert Kirkman's post-apocalyptic adventure inspiring everything from board games to amusement park attractions. A popular offshoot has been Telltale Games' brilliant video game series, which recently debuted its third season, and one very interesting interaction in the game has inspired fans to wonder if it's possible digital heroine Clementine will could make it to live-action. Here's how it was addressed by editor Sean Mackiewicz in the latest issue of the comic book.


(window._jsqueue=window._jsqueue||[]).push("f73fad29-e2a6-4c80-9c5d-24635091164b");


Telltale's latest installment of their TWD game series, The New Frontier, occurs during the time jump after TWD #126. So a lot could happen before she ever appeared. And that's not me being coy. I have no idea ... yet. It takes time to write those things.



(window._jsqueue=window._jsqueue||[]).push("e962b39d-b6a9-4568-bdee-df8a6d0fcb28");

I know some people out there are whooping it up at the thought of Clementine being introduced into Team Family (or however she'd go about popping through). Starting off in Season 1 as a potentially orphaned girl unable to cope with the madness around her, Clementine evolved into a brave, thoughtful and pretty hardcore young teen in Episode 3. Not to knock almost all of the children that have popped up on The Walking Dead's TV show in the past - because I've already done that in full here - but there hasn't been any youngin nearly as charismatic and sympathetic as Clementine on the TV show. Her presence would be beyond welcomed.


(window._jsqueue=window._jsqueue||[]).push("24c90697-b601-4d56-814f-35397109915c");

 


(window._jsqueue=window._jsqueue||[]).push("9c157a0a-0cf6-46bf-940d-50ac9e597e18");

Without getting into details, the interaction that occurred on The Walking Dead: The New Frontier was between Clementine and another franchise fan favorite, Jesus. A match made in a Kirkman-written heaven if there ever was one, and one that has a legitimate shot at hitting AMC's The Walking Dead at some point in the future, thanks to the comic book's two-year time jump not being the most feasible plot choice to make for the TV show. It's likely a smaller shift will happen with Rick's live-action group, with a mix of existing comic plots mixed with new stories that Robert Kirkman conceived as backstory for the comic's jump. Which is presumably where the story for A New Frontier came from.

(window._jsqueue=window._jsqueue||[]).push("e2d68e84-7f9a-4eca-b5cb-48aae6c11fb9");

Everybody always wants to see characters from the various Walking Dead branches come together, and although Robert Kirkman and showrunner Scott Gimple have been pretty down on getting Fear the Walking Dead involved due to location issues, Telltales Games' series doesn't have such an issue. There was a dedicated effort to mesh the comic series with the video game for this newest season, which is the easiest step to take to bring those particular stories to TV, so here's hoping that pans out accordingly. And if Clementine is a possibility for later seasons, that opens it up for all the other characters to make appearances as well. Imagine getting to see Lee or Kenny in All Out War in Season 8.


(window._jsqueue=window._jsqueue||[]).push("9d4476c4-33b7-4a94-9f5d-30b5665f8665");

The Walking Dead: A New Frontier will release Episode 3 at to-be-announced date, but The Walking Dead TV show will return to AMC for the remainder of Season 7 on Sunday, February 12, at 9:00 p.m. ET. Fun fact: the latest issue of The Walking Dead, in which the above answer was given, is only 25 cents, so go buy it.

The Walking Dead may have existed solely as a comic book at one time, but those days are long gone, with Robert Kirkman's post-apocalyptic adventure inspiring everything from board games to amusement park attractions.

Telltale's latest installment of their TWD game series, The New Frontier, occurs during the time jump after TWD #126. So a lot could happen before she ever appeared. And that's not me being coy. I have no idea ... yet. It takes time to write those things.

I know some people out there are whooping it up at the thought of Clementine being introduced into Team Family (or however she'd go about popping through). Starting off in Season 1 as a potentially orphaned girl unable to cope with the madness around her, Clementine evolved into a brave, thoughtful and pretty hardcore young teen in Episode 3. Not to knock almost all of the children that have popped up on The Walking Dead's TV show in the past - because I've already done that in full here - but there hasn't been any youngin nearly as charismatic and sympathetic as Clementine on the TV show. Her presence would be beyond welcomed.

Without getting into details, the interaction that occurred on The Walking Dead: The New Frontier was between Clementine and another franchise fan favorite, Jesus. A match made in a Kirkman-written heaven if there ever was one, and one that has a legitimate shot at hitting AMC's The Walking Dead at some point in the future, thanks to the comic book's two-year time jump not being the most feasible plot choice to make for the TV show. It's likely a smaller shift will happen with Rick's live-action group, with a mix of existing comic plots mixed with new stories that Robert Kirkman conceived as backstory for the comic's jump. Which is presumably where the story for A New Frontier came from.

Everybody always wants to see characters from the various Walking Dead branches come together, and although Robert Kirkman and showrunner Scott Gimple have been pretty down on getting Fear the Walking Dead involved due to location issues, Telltales Games' series doesn't have such an issue. There was a dedicated effort to mesh the comic series with the video game for this newest season, which is the easiest step to take to bring those particular stories to TV, so here's hoping that pans out accordingly. And if Clementine is a possibility for later seasons, that opens it up for all the other characters to make appearances as well. Imagine getting to see Lee or Kenny in All Out War in Season 8.
