Do LaB 2018

WatcharaDo LaB 2018


From the main stage to the Sahara tent, Coachella has fully embraced electronic dance, but nowhere is that love of beats and bass more apparent than in its annual partnership with the Do LaB. The California event company behind Lightning in a Bottle has brought bangin' DJs and producers to Indio Valley for more than 15 years running, and in 2019, the lineup is stacked with legends and up-and-comers alike.Each weekend gets its own lineup. Weekend one fans can catch Pete Tong b2b with a special guest, Mr. Carmack, Elderbrook and Billboard Dance Ones to Watch alumni Golden Features and YUNG BAE. Weekend two attendees can look forward to sets from Justin Jay, Escapade (Walker & Royce with Ardalan), Madam X and LSDream. Both weekends will feature a break from the desert sun under the Do LaB's exciting art tent with water guns sprays and all manner of rowdy fun.
