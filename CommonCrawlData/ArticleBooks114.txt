By Ligaya MishanAugust 12, 2008In the Wall Street Journal, Jeff Bezos, of Amazon, notes the drawbacks of physical books—you “get hand fatigue” if they’re really heavy (e.g., “The Man Without Qualities”) and your spouse might complain if you turn the pages too loudly—and the advantages of the Kindle:Being able to easily look up words in the dictionary: “I find I don’t know what lots of words mean, and I used to guess because—am I really going to get up off of the sofa and go find a dictionary?”Changing the font size: “a very simple thing that’s much appreciated.”Wireless delivery of books in less than sixty seconds: “You don’t have the cognitive overhead of thinking about your monthly wireless bill. You don’t have to know who the wireless carrier is. We’re hiding all of that complexity.”Freed of complexity and cognitive overhead (otherwise known as “thinking”), consumers can concentrate on fulfilling their destiny as “information snackers.” And while some among us may be nostalgic for the good old days of ink and paper, Bezos gently reminds naysayers that “what’s really important is not the container, it’s the narrative.” As he points out,You’re not going to keep riding your horse to work just because you love your horse.—Ligaya MishanDive into the world of literature with The New Yorker’s weekly fiction newsletter.By Ben TaubBy Mike SpiesBy Susan B.
