		Saturday 20 April 2019 By Nina Caplan1:15PM BST 20 Apr 2010 Oh business – how can people?’ wailed Nancy Mitford while attempting to discuss her share of Mayfair bookshop Heywood Hill in 1948; amazingly, it’s still there, even though the hilarious letters between Mitford and Hill make it clear that when it came to business, these people couldn’t, really.  Any bookseller who requires his own slang term (to couch) for ‘to place in a pile and leave until dust settles or emergency strikes’ was probably never going to die rich.  Then again, if you want business acuity in a bookshop, go to the relevant shelf: it has rarely been found behind the counter. The Net Book Agreement, which precluded discounts until the Nineties, and the absence of any real competition before the internet, meant that until recently practically anyone could make a living (but not a fortune) selling books.  George Orwell, writing in 1936, reckoned that since the corporates would never be able to squeeze independent booksellers the way they had the grocer or the milkman, ‘it is a humane trade which is not capable of being vulgarised beyond a certain point’.  He was wrong about big business – these days, some bookshops are decidedly more equal than others – but while 102 (nearly 10 per cent of the total) closed in 2009, according to the Booksellers Association, there are still independents dotted all over the country, usually in villages and market towns where they help reinforce a sense of community. Which is odd when you consider that reading is one of the most solitary pursuits around  Small bookshops, however, are gregarious: when I set out to find those that were doing well and how they were managing to hold back the tide of so-called progress, I encountered roaring fires, free coffee and regulars who were greeted by name and were happy to talk, especially about books.  I was there in search of personalities – the booksellers, of course, but also the shops themselves, which despite their similarities had, like dogs are said to, come to resemble their owners. No small business is having an easy time at the moment, although the internet actually gives at least as much as it takes away: most of the people I spoke to sell online, find books for customers that way and even order through Amazon for people who don’t want to do so themselves.  In fact, it is publishers who are really causing the small shops trouble by undercutting them. Apparently they don’t see how cannibalistic this is: kill the little businesses and they’ll be entirely at Amazon’s mercy.  Still, for the moment, the death of the independent bookshop has been greatly exaggerated, so I have selected these rather as one chooses books in a good shop: by running my finger along the possibilities, stopping when something catches my fancy and pulling out those that look really enticing for closer examination.  And, as with good fiction, I have been rewarded with a range of unforgettable characters, overcoming great obstacles and devoting their considerable powers of invention to overseeing bookshops that have as little in common with a blank-faced chain outlet as a newsletter does with a novel.  1 Mr B’s Reading Emporium, Bath   14-15 John Street, 01225 331155; www.mrbsemporium.com (pictured)  Down a titchy street just off the main drag is a pine-lined shop that feels spacious but isn’t: owner Nic Bottomley simply doesn’t go for the atmospheric clutter germane to most booklovers. (‘Books give off more and nastier dust than any other class of objects yet invented,’ Orwell grumbled, ‘and the top of a book is the place where every bluebottle prefers to die.’) Nic is also young, blonde, nattily dressed and exceptionally good at publicity, all of which is so uncommon in this trade that I wonder if he took the wrong turning en route to a real job.  Actually, he was a derivatives trader who cut and ran, taking over an antiques shop’s spare showroom in 2006. Now he has teatowels with cleverly altered quotations (‘a single man in possession of a fortune should spend it at Mr B’s’), a Victorian bath covered in books and a reading booth where, for £3.50, you get a comfy chair, headphones, coffee, biscuits and a closed door with a Do Not Disturb sign. His staff are beyond helpful: clearly living the dream with him, and this spirit of togetherness shows in the handwritten recommendations, complete with cartoons (‘we’ve Simpsonised ourselves!’) that dot the shelves.  Ed expounds his theory that clever publishers are making books into ever more desirable objects, and shows me one with a cover that pulls off to become a map and another with ye olde ruffled page edges, to prove it, while Nic deals with a regular who wants a ‘history of something?’ for his wife, pinpointing Andrew Marr’s A History of Modern Britain within a minute, and sending the man wafting out the door on a blast of information about a forthcoming Marr event, like Mary Poppins carried off by the west wind.  Naturally, Nic is an expert internet user with a blog, a sophisticated stock-searching system and a mass of online sales, but he doesn’t fear the beast, partly because he has tamed it (Mexican-American Pulitzer finalist Luis Alberto Urrea is taking time out of a family holiday to give a talk at Mr B’s on the back of Nic’s mini-review of his book on Twitter) and partly because he understands what it cannot give. He sells a reading spa package, which gets you lots of books and a goody bag but also, and more importantly, an extensive chat over coffee and cake with him about your likes and dislikes. It is, arguably, what booksellers do anyway, but it’s very popular, as expert help generally is and probably – people being sociable creatures – always will be.  2 Al Saqi Books, London   26 Westbourne Grove, 020 7229 8543; www.alsaqibookshop.com   Murder One, the crime bookshop has gone; Charing Cross Road resembles a denuded bookshelf, with a couple of forgotten paperbacks still littering its length. Indomitable Foyles remains and the antiquarian bookshops of Cecil Court; elsewhere, independents still glow like candlelight amid the glare of generic high street shops. There are even brave new ventures, such as the kiosk-sized Herne Hill Books and To Hell With Publishing’s boutique near King’s Cross.  In the city that has everything, though, it is the specialists who are thriving: if you are a foodie, you want to visit Books for Cooks in Notting Hill; if you have itchy feet, Stanfords is the place to scratch them; should you want your children reading in an atmosphere congenial to adults, there’s Victoria Park Books in Hackney; while Al Saqi, the Middle Eastern bookshop near Paddington, caters to Arabic speakers and Anglophones interested in the area – as well as an international readership trying to get hold of books that are banned in the countries in which they are written.  Al Saqi (which means ‘the one who gives you water’) was started in 1979 by the Lebanese sculptress and humanitarian activist Mai Ghoussoub (‘words don’t kill – humans do’) and her friend André Gaspard. Since Ghoussoub’s death in 2007, the shop has been run by Gaspard’s wife, Salwa; the English and Arabic publishing arms are run separately but are, Salwa says, ‘like a family tree’.  The shop sells online but suffers from internet discounting, although Amazon hasn’t started selling Arabic language books yet, but what helps is that ‘we’re very academic and very open-minded’ – an unusual combination. This shop, even more than most of these ‘tiny first-class kennels for underdogs’ (Hill’s phrase), is a safe haven for persecuted literature.  3 Wenlock Books, Much Wenlock   12 High Street, 01952 727877; www.wenlockbooks.co.uk   Anna Dreda is trying to sell tickets to her forthcoming Poetry Festival (patron: Carol Ann Duffy) to those too Luddite to buy them online, so she doesn’t have time to talk, but she does. Clearing a space upstairs, among the second-hand stock (downstairs is new), she tells me about reading Women’s Studies at Birmingham, bringing up children, doing youth work until this chance came up 18 years ago and she gave up everything ‘except circle dancing’. The shop, on the adorable high street of this pretty market town, reflects her tastes: one shelf of humour but five of women’s studies and some very eclectic CDs. There’s a travel section up front and the inevitable local interest books, and a loyal local clientele, supplemented by tourists. However, Anna no longer sells on the internet: ‘I was spending time stuffing books into bags and I didn’t buy this place to do that.’  Anna, who created her own surname by truncating her mother’s first name when she got divorced, is clearly strong-minded, but charming and informal with it: I follow a trail of bookshelves up a staircase and find myself in her office – there is no door to keep punters out. And the regulars’ loyalty is returned: she likes, she says, to buy her second-hand books from people that she’s known ‘so I can pass on stories to the new owners’.  In this spirit, she shows me a book called Pulled Thread Embroidery, owned by Anne Robertson, a local doctor’s wife who used to sew avidly while doing phone duty for her husband. The couple are now frail and have gone into assisted living. ‘They both spent their lives helping the community,’ Anna says, opening the book. A handsewn sampler falls out. We both exclaim over its prettiness but she firmly replaces it – a gift for the book’s purchaser. Then it’s back to the front desk. The Poetry Festival has deprived me of the coffee and WI cake Anna offers punters; I just hope attendees appreciate my sacrifice.  4 Barter Books, Alnwick   Alnwick Station, Wagon Way Road, 01665 604888; www.barterbooks.co.uk   Stuart Manley was a railway enthusiast running a struggling model train shop in a decommissioned station when his wife, Mary, pointed out that books might sell better. Almost 20 years later, they have most of the huge building and have done it up wonderfully: people lounge around reading before a roaring fire in the old waiting room, while the ticket hall smells most inauthentically of good coffee.  Mary deals with externals, he deals with finance, Stuart says, but the gentle whish of the model railway running above the bookshelves was surely his doing. The place is an extraordinary mixture of the canny and the casual: people turning up with boxes of books to barter (‘our most revolutionary idea was being nice to the customers: we can’t take every book but we can be polite about it’), quotes by Baudelaire and Keats strung between shelves, replica Edwardian lunch boxes full of biscuits for sale, as well as every possible permutation of the Second World War poster Stuart famously found in a box of bartered books. ‘Keep Calm and Carry On’ blares from a red background; the poster was never distributed (the only other known original is in the Imperial War Museum), but when Stuart put it up he was deluged with requests to buy a copy. The proceeds must help the ongoing work on this gargantuan – and listed – building.  Stuart says visiting the bigger Hay shops showed him that his 8,000sq ft was enough, although I don’t believe for a minute he’ll stop there. With the carpets, classical music and first editions ranged in cases along the walls, not to mention the literary figures in the trompe l’oeil mural under the eaves, he and Mary have found a way to marry their twin obsessions for trains and books into a place that’s a haven for geeks, and for those just trying to follow the instructions on the poster.  5 Topping & Company, Ely  9 High Street, 01353 645005; www.toppingbooks.co.uk   There’s a rep from publisher Little, Brown, chatting easily at the cash desk in Robert Topping’s woodlined, book-crammed shop next to Ely Cathedral; many of the bigger stores no longer welcome personal visits, he says, but he has a great relationship with Topping’s.  Like so many of today’s independent booksellers, Topping learnt his trade at Waterstone’s, back before founder Tim Waterstone sold up, when the chain was the most exciting thing to happen to bookselling since the invention of the paperback. But before that, he learnt how not to sell them. ‘I first worked at Foyle’s [in London]. I lasted eight months, which was pretty good – Miss Foyle fired everyone sooner or later.’ But that meant you got lots of responsibility really quickly, because your predecessor had probably been fired shortly before you arrived. There was no external phone line, so ordering a book involved ‘sneaking into the manager’s office and using the phone when no one was looking’.  After that, Waterstone was a revelation. ‘He was a wonderful, inspiring man,’ Topping says wistfully. ‘His shops were crammed with books.’ This is clearly Topping’s highest praise: his own three-floor shop (he has another in Bath) is stuffed with them, albeit in an orderly way. We sit at a table in a window-nook, drinking the coffee that is offered free to customers (except he winces at the word customers: ‘the people who come in here love books. They are friends… supporters… our community’). Why not have a café? ‘I’m too jealous of the space. We’re booksellers, not shop owners, so the coffee is free but if we’re busy it arrives a bit more slowly.’  This being a family concern, the handwritten signs on the elegant wooden bookshelves are by his wife, while his son deals with the internet. Topping is no slouch on the recommendation front, informing me that Rose Tremain’s Trespass will be book of the year, even though such certainty has bitten him on the backside occasionally: when Julian Barnes gave a talk in the shop, he announced to the packed crowd that Arthur & George would win the Booker or he, Robert, would eat his hat; it didn’t.  A few months later, Barnes gave a talk at the other shop, with Topping hoping he would have forgotten his rash support; instead, an enormous cake, ordered by the mischievous author, was wheeled in, and the bookseller – along with everyone else – duly ate it.  6 Wigtown, Dumfries & Galloway  www.wigtownbookfestival.com   If you were to look to the left as you zoomed up the M74 towards Glasgow and the Highlands, and you had Superman vision, you would spot Wigtown, about 85 miles away on a promontory that juts towards Ireland. The broad, gracious main square bears witness to the town’s importance in the 19th century and earlier, but by the Eighties the county seat had moved to Dumfries, the creamery and distillery had closed down and the place bore glum witness to Scotland’s industrial decline.  All of which made it a perfect candidate to win a rather unconventional competition aimed at regeneration through bookshops – which it did, becoming Scotland’s official book town in 1997. Now there are 14 booksellers, lots of painters and decorators driving fancy new cars and a town that is managing, if not quite thriving, through the windy end of a chilly winter. In summer, I’m told, the shops are packed, while September heralds the Wigtown Book Festival, during which marquees go up on bookshop lawns, famous authors take over the biggest bookshop’s drawing room and everyone overdoses on literature and gourmet food.  The rest of the time, bookworms can visit at least six bookshops on the main drag, from Reading Lasses, a bookshop with a female bias (Virago classics, an anthology called I Dream of Madonna and a calendar featuring pert farmers in various stages of undress) and an excellent café with homemade cakes; Byre Books (technically a converted stable, not a byre, and probably only big enough for a Shetland pony at that, but full of interesting tomes on mythology, film, theatre and Scotland); The Bookshop, Wigtown’s (and, according to owner Shaun Bythell, Scotland’s) biggest independent bookshop; The Box of Frogs, a children’s bookshop and gift shop; and The Book End Studio, where Julie Houston juggles a toddler, a cleaning job and her own painting with selling books, art and children’s toys. There is also The Old Bank, which was the customs house at the back and a bank at the front until the directors were jailed in 1878 for ‘uttering false accounts’. This solid, spacious building has a whole roomful of scores, sheet music and songbooks, as well as more general stock and is now run by Helena, age five, with occasional humble contributions from her parents, Joyce and Ian.  Wigtown is such an eccentric spot (‘come into this mad place!’, one owner welcomed me, and she isn’t kidding: within 24 hours someone had offered to sell me a bookshop, and the Wild Goose Chase signs are not a reference to the town’s inaccessibility but to an actual event involving real birds), so ensconced in a mythological bygone era where business fitted around chat and the shop was the bit below the family home, that it did not surprise me at all to find that most of the booksellers don’t do much online. ‘That’s always next year’s project,’ several of them told me – but in Wigtown, I’m not sure next year ever comes.  7 News From Nowhere, Liverpool  96 Bold St, 0151 708 7270; www.newsfromnowhere.org.uk   ‘We are sensitive to all things to do with women and women having a life,’ says Sara, the newbie member (a mere eight years) of the women’s co-op that runs this radical bookshop. If the place had a matriarch, which it doesn’t, being a socialist organisation, then Mandy would fill the role: she has been here since 1976 and has the flowing robes, patient smile and leftist politics you’d expect.  Their computer also looks to have arrived in the mid-Seventies – it even has a flashing cursor. But it can find the internet and the shop does sell online, although this is a real community hub, which is presumably how it survives on a dilapidated high street that has lost out to a big new shopping centre, and that houses two other bookshops. Mandy is unperturbed. ‘It’s better to be near each other,’ she says, ‘it’s handy for people who like browsing bookshops.’  The place is shabby but loved, with a rack of newsletters, a section devoted to violence against women but also lots of fiction and history, particularly Irish (‘we were a major source of information through the Troubles’). They do stock books by men; they also have a children’s corner with world folk tales.  Mandy points out that Liverpool has a history of radicalism and that the shop’s supporters rally around when they get into trouble, offering credit loans against future purchases; and they do a lot with John Moores University.  While I’m there, a young man asks Mandy for a book which has to be ordered from the US. Hearing that there is a copy in, but it’s promised to someone, he offers to pay extra. I watch fascinated as socialist principle confronts the spectre of ravening capitalism (admittedly, in the shape of a guy who wants to get his chum a present). Mandy shakes her head firmly: one small step for mankind.  8 Poetry Bookshop, Hay-on-Wye   Ice House, Brook Street, 01497 821812; www.poetrybookshop.com   The Princes weren’t going to show me the Georgian ice house beneath their little shop in Hay-on-Wye, but I asked about foreign language poetry and that’s stored downstairs.  The enormous brick-lined cylinder, like a giant well, would have been packed with ice; now, thanks to electricity and refrigerators, it’s redundant. Maybe the sheer weirdness of the legendary book town on the Welsh borders, where even the local café’s menu says, ‘Please note: these dishes are prepared in a nutty environment’, is affecting me, but I know I wouldn’t want quite such a majestic symbol of obsolescence beneath my obscure specialist bookshop.  With his long hair and thin grey sweater, Chris looks like a cliché of a poetry obsessive, although actually he was just looking for something to do when this shop came up for sale. With an older, male customer who is threatening to sleep in the field where book festival events take place (the 80,000 visitors have outgrown even the town’s 30-odd bookshops), a lively three-way discussion on old jazz sleevenotes gets under way, soon shading into the inevitable conversation on the future of bookshops.  Chris acknowledges that being a specialist limits both his purchasing possibilities and his customer base but, he says, ‘people like the idea that a poetry bookshop exists. And if you like poetry books – and I know a lot of people can live without them – then it’s wonderful to be in a room with so many.’ He does find the internet threatening because ‘it makes everybody an expert’ and he thinks the Government should subsidise bookshop rents because they bring culture to the high street, which leads to a three-way row: I don’t feel that’s viable.  During this I discover that the customer is not a customer but a published poet. So he may have been serious about kipping in the field. Related PartnersLove puzzles?

Britain's best independent bookshops

One has a railway running along its shelves, another displays its wares in a 
  Victorian bath. Small bookshops aren't dead, they're thriving, and we've 
  hunted down the best.

With the carpets, classical music and first editions ranged in cases along the walls, not to mention the literary figures in the trompe l’oeil mural under the eaves, he and Mary have found a way to marry their twin obsessions for trains and books into a place that’s a haven for geeks, and for those just trying to follow the instructions on the poster.  5 Topping & Company, Ely  9 High Street, 01353 645005; www.toppingbooks.co.uk   There’s a rep from publisher Little, Brown, chatting easily at the cash desk in Robert Topping’s woodlined, book-crammed shop next to Ely Cathedral; many of the bigger stores no longer welcome personal visits, he says, but he has a great relationship with Topping’s.  Like so many of today’s independent booksellers, Topping learnt his trade at Waterstone’s, back before founder Tim Waterstone sold up, when the chain was the most exciting thing to happen to bookselling since the invention of the paperback. But before that, he learnt how not to sell them. ‘I first worked at Foyle’s [in London]. I lasted eight months, which was pretty good – Miss Foyle fired everyone sooner or later.’ But that meant you got lots of responsibility really quickly, because your predecessor had probably been fired shortly before you arrived. There was no external phone line, so ordering a book involved ‘sneaking into the manager’s office and using the phone when no one was looking’.  After that, Waterstone was a revelation. ‘He was a wonderful, inspiring man,’ Topping says wistfully. ‘His shops were crammed with books.’ This is clearly Topping’s highest praise: his own three-floor shop (he has another in Bath) is stuffed with them, albeit in an orderly way. We sit at a table in a window-nook, drinking the coffee that is offered free to customers (except he winces at the word customers: ‘the people who come in here love books. They are friends… supporters… our community’). Why not have a café? ‘I’m too jealous of the space. We’re booksellers, not shop owners, so the coffee is free but if we’re busy it arrives a bit more slowly.’  This being a family concern, the handwritten signs on the elegant wooden bookshelves are by his wife, while his son deals with the internet. Topping is no slouch on the recommendation front, informing me that Rose Tremain’s Trespass will be book of the year, even though such certainty has bitten him on the backside occasionally: when Julian Barnes gave a talk in the shop, he announced to the packed crowd that Arthur & George would win the Booker or he, Robert, would eat his hat; it didn’t.  A few months later, Barnes gave a talk at the other shop, with Topping hoping he would have forgotten his rash support; instead, an enormous cake, ordered by the mischievous author, was wheeled in, and the bookseller – along with everyone else – duly ate it.  6 Wigtown, Dumfries & Galloway  www.wigtownbookfestival.com   If you were to look to the left as you zoomed up the M74 towards Glasgow and the Highlands, and you had Superman vision, you would spot Wigtown, about 85 miles away on a promontory that juts towards Ireland. The broad, gracious main square bears witness to the town’s importance in the 19th century and earlier, but by the Eighties the county seat had moved to Dumfries, the creamery and distillery had closed down and the place bore glum witness to Scotland’s industrial decline.  All of which made it a perfect candidate to win a rather unconventional competition aimed at regeneration through bookshops – which it did, becoming Scotland’s official book town in 1997. Now there are 14 booksellers, lots of painters and decorators driving fancy new cars and a town that is managing, if not quite thriving, through the windy end of a chilly winter. In summer, I’m told, the shops are packed, while September heralds the Wigtown Book Festival, during which marquees go up on bookshop lawns, famous authors take over the biggest bookshop’s drawing room and everyone overdoses on literature and gourmet food.  The rest of the time, bookworms can visit at least six bookshops on the main drag, from Reading Lasses, a bookshop with a female bias (Virago classics, an anthology called I Dream of Madonna and a calendar featuring pert farmers in various stages of undress) and an excellent café with homemade cakes; Byre Books (technically a converted stable, not a byre, and probably only big enough for a Shetland pony at that, but full of interesting tomes on mythology, film, theatre and Scotland); The Bookshop, Wigtown’s (and, according to owner Shaun Bythell, Scotland’s) biggest independent bookshop; The Box of Frogs, a children’s bookshop and gift shop; and The Book End Studio, where Julie Houston juggles a toddler, a cleaning job and her own painting with selling books, art and children’s toys. There is also The Old Bank, which was the customs house at the back and a bank at the front until the directors were jailed in 1878 for ‘uttering false accounts’. This solid, spacious building has a whole roomful of scores, sheet music and songbooks, as well as more general stock and is now run by Helena, age five, with occasional humble contributions from her parents, Joyce and Ian.  Wigtown is such an eccentric spot (‘come into this mad place!’, one owner welcomed me, and she isn’t kidding: within 24 hours someone had offered to sell me a bookshop, and the Wild Goose Chase signs are not a reference to the town’s inaccessibility but to an actual event involving real birds), so ensconced in a mythological bygone era where business fitted around chat and the shop was the bit below the family home, that it did not surprise me at all to find that most of the booksellers don’t do much online. ‘That’s always next year’s project,’ several of them told me – but in Wigtown, I’m not sure next year ever comes.  7 News From Nowhere, Liverpool  96 Bold St, 0151 708 7270; www.newsfromnowhere.org.uk   ‘We are sensitive to all things to do with women and women having a life,’ says Sara, the newbie member (a mere eight years) of the women’s co-op that runs this radical bookshop. If the place had a matriarch, which it doesn’t, being a socialist organisation, then Mandy would fill the role: she has been here since 1976 and has the flowing robes, patient smile and leftist politics you’d expect.  Their computer also looks to have arrived in the mid-Seventies – it even has a flashing cursor. But it can find the internet and the shop does sell online, although this is a real community hub, which is presumably how it survives on a dilapidated high street that has lost out to a big new shopping centre, and that houses two other bookshops. Mandy is unperturbed. ‘It’s better to be near each other,’ she says, ‘it’s handy for people who like browsing bookshops.’  The place is shabby but loved, with a rack of newsletters, a section devoted to violence against women but also lots of fiction and history, particularly Irish (‘we were a major source of information through the Troubles’). They do stock books by men; they also have a children’s corner with world folk tales.  Mandy points out that Liverpool has a history of radicalism and that the shop’s supporters rally around when they get into trouble, offering credit loans against future purchases; and they do a lot with John Moores University.  While I’m there, a young man asks Mandy for a book which has to be ordered from the US. Hearing that there is a copy in, but it’s promised to someone, he offers to pay extra. I watch fascinated as socialist principle confronts the spectre of ravening capitalism (admittedly, in the shape of a guy who wants to get his chum a present). Mandy shakes her head firmly: one small step for mankind.  8 Poetry Bookshop, Hay-on-Wye   Ice House, Brook Street, 01497 821812; www.poetrybookshop.com   The Princes weren’t going to show me the Georgian ice house beneath their little shop in Hay-on-Wye, but I asked about foreign language poetry and that’s stored downstairs.  The enormous brick-lined cylinder, like a giant well, would have been packed with ice; now, thanks to electricity and refrigerators, it’s redundant. Maybe the sheer weirdness of the legendary book town on the Welsh borders, where even the local café’s menu says, ‘Please note: these dishes are prepared in a nutty environment’, is affecting me, but I know I wouldn’t want quite such a majestic symbol of obsolescence beneath my obscure specialist bookshop.  With his long hair and thin grey sweater, Chris looks like a cliché of a poetry obsessive, although actually he was just looking for something to do when this shop came up for sale. With an older, male customer who is threatening to sleep in the field where book festival events take place (the 80,000 visitors have outgrown even the town’s 30-odd bookshops), a lively three-way discussion on old jazz sleevenotes gets under way, soon shading into the inevitable conversation on the future of bookshops.  Chris acknowledges that being a specialist limits both his purchasing possibilities and his customer base but, he says, ‘people like the idea that a poetry bookshop exists. And if you like poetry books – and I know a lot of people can live without them – then it’s wonderful to be in a room with so many.’ He does find the internet threatening because ‘it makes everybody an expert’ and he thinks the Government should subsidise bookshop rents because they bring culture to the high street, which leads to a three-way row: I don’t feel that’s viable.  During this I discover that the customer is not a customer but a published poet. So he may have been serious about kipping in the field.

Britain's best independent bookshops

One has a railway running along its shelves, another displays its wares in a 
  Victorian bath. Small bookshops aren't dead, they're thriving, and we've 
  hunted down the best.

 Oh business – how can people?’ wailed Nancy Mitford while attempting to discuss her share of Mayfair bookshop Heywood Hill in 1948; amazingly, it’s still there, even though the hilarious letters between Mitford and Hill make it clear that when it came to business, these people couldn’t, really.  Any bookseller who requires his own slang term (to couch) for ‘to place in a pile and leave until dust settles or emergency strikes’ was probably never going to die rich.  Then again, if you want business acuity in a bookshop, go to the relevant shelf: it has rarely been found behind the counter. The Net Book Agreement, which precluded discounts until the Nineties, and the absence of any real competition before the internet, meant that until recently practically anyone could make a living (but not a fortune) selling books.  George Orwell, writing in 1936, reckoned that since the corporates would never be able to squeeze independent booksellers the way they had the grocer or the milkman, ‘it is a humane trade which is not capable of being vulgarised beyond a certain point’.  He was wrong about big business – these days, some bookshops are decidedly more equal than others – but while 102 (nearly 10 per cent of the total) closed in 2009, according to the Booksellers Association, there are still independents dotted all over the country, usually in villages and market towns where they help reinforce a sense of community. Which is odd when you consider that reading is one of the most solitary pursuits around  Small bookshops, however, are gregarious: when I set out to find those that were doing well and how they were managing to hold back the tide of so-called progress, I encountered roaring fires, free coffee and regulars who were greeted by name and were happy to talk, especially about books.  I was there in search of personalities – the booksellers, of course, but also the shops themselves, which despite their similarities had, like dogs are said to, come to resemble their owners. No small business is having an easy time at the moment, although the internet actually gives at least as much as it takes away: most of the people I spoke to sell online, find books for customers that way and even order through Amazon for people who don’t want to do so themselves.  In fact, it is publishers who are really causing the small shops trouble by undercutting them. Apparently they don’t see how cannibalistic this is: kill the little businesses and they’ll be entirely at Amazon’s mercy.  Still, for the moment, the death of the independent bookshop has been greatly exaggerated, so I have selected these rather as one chooses books in a good shop: by running my finger along the possibilities, stopping when something catches my fancy and pulling out those that look really enticing for closer examination.  And, as with good fiction, I have been rewarded with a range of unforgettable characters, overcoming great obstacles and devoting their considerable powers of invention to overseeing bookshops that have as little in common with a blank-faced chain outlet as a newsletter does with a novel.  1 Mr B’s Reading Emporium, Bath   14-15 John Street, 01225 331155; www.mrbsemporium.com (pictured)  Down a titchy street just off the main drag is a pine-lined shop that feels spacious but isn’t: owner Nic Bottomley simply doesn’t go for the atmospheric clutter germane to most booklovers. (‘Books give off more and nastier dust than any other class of objects yet invented,’ Orwell grumbled, ‘and the top of a book is the place where every bluebottle prefers to die.’) Nic is also young, blonde, nattily dressed and exceptionally good at publicity, all of which is so uncommon in this trade that I wonder if he took the wrong turning en route to a real job.  Actually, he was a derivatives trader who cut and ran, taking over an antiques shop’s spare showroom in 2006. Now he has teatowels with cleverly altered quotations (‘a single man in possession of a fortune should spend it at Mr B’s’), a Victorian bath covered in books and a reading booth where, for £3.50, you get a comfy chair, headphones, coffee, biscuits and a closed door with a Do Not Disturb sign. His staff are beyond helpful: clearly living the dream with him, and this spirit of togetherness shows in the handwritten recommendations, complete with cartoons (‘we’ve Simpsonised ourselves!’) that dot the shelves.  Ed expounds his theory that clever publishers are making books into ever more desirable objects, and shows me one with a cover that pulls off to become a map and another with ye olde ruffled page edges, to prove it, while Nic deals with a regular who wants a ‘history of something?’ for his wife, pinpointing Andrew Marr’s A History of Modern Britain within a minute, and sending the man wafting out the door on a blast of information about a forthcoming Marr event, like Mary Poppins carried off by the west wind.  Naturally, Nic is an expert internet user with a blog, a sophisticated stock-searching system and a mass of online sales, but he doesn’t fear the beast, partly because he has tamed it (Mexican-American Pulitzer finalist Luis Alberto Urrea is taking time out of a family holiday to give a talk at Mr B’s on the back of Nic’s mini-review of his book on Twitter) and partly because he understands what it cannot give. He sells a reading spa package, which gets you lots of books and a goody bag but also, and more importantly, an extensive chat over coffee and cake with him about your likes and dislikes. It is, arguably, what booksellers do anyway, but it’s very popular, as expert help generally is and probably – people being sociable creatures – always will be.  2 Al Saqi Books, London   26 Westbourne Grove, 020 7229 8543; www.alsaqibookshop.com   Murder One, the crime bookshop has gone; Charing Cross Road resembles a denuded bookshelf, with a couple of forgotten paperbacks still littering its length. Indomitable Foyles remains and the antiquarian bookshops of Cecil Court; elsewhere, independents still glow like candlelight amid the glare of generic high street shops. There are even brave new ventures, such as the kiosk-sized Herne Hill Books and To Hell With Publishing’s boutique near King’s Cross.  In the city that has everything, though, it is the specialists who are thriving: if you are a foodie, you want to visit Books for Cooks in Notting Hill; if you have itchy feet, Stanfords is the place to scratch them; should you want your children reading in an atmosphere congenial to adults, there’s Victoria Park Books in Hackney; while Al Saqi, the Middle Eastern bookshop near Paddington, caters to Arabic speakers and Anglophones interested in the area – as well as an international readership trying to get hold of books that are banned in the countries in which they are written.  Al Saqi (which means ‘the one who gives you water’) was started in 1979 by the Lebanese sculptress and humanitarian activist Mai Ghoussoub (‘words don’t kill – humans do’) and her friend André Gaspard. Since Ghoussoub’s death in 2007, the shop has been run by Gaspard’s wife, Salwa; the English and Arabic publishing arms are run separately but are, Salwa says, ‘like a family tree’.  The shop sells online but suffers from internet discounting, although Amazon hasn’t started selling Arabic language books yet, but what helps is that ‘we’re very academic and very open-minded’ – an unusual combination. This shop, even more than most of these ‘tiny first-class kennels for underdogs’ (Hill’s phrase), is a safe haven for persecuted literature.  3 Wenlock Books, Much Wenlock   12 High Street, 01952 727877; www.wenlockbooks.co.uk   Anna Dreda is trying to sell tickets to her forthcoming Poetry Festival (patron: Carol Ann Duffy) to those too Luddite to buy them online, so she doesn’t have time to talk, but she does. Clearing a space upstairs, among the second-hand stock (downstairs is new), she tells me about reading Women’s Studies at Birmingham, bringing up children, doing youth work until this chance came up 18 years ago and she gave up everything ‘except circle dancing’. The shop, on the adorable high street of this pretty market town, reflects her tastes: one shelf of humour but five of women’s studies and some very eclectic CDs. There’s a travel section up front and the inevitable local interest books, and a loyal local clientele, supplemented by tourists. However, Anna no longer sells on the internet: ‘I was spending time stuffing books into bags and I didn’t buy this place to do that.’  Anna, who created her own surname by truncating her mother’s first name when she got divorced, is clearly strong-minded, but charming and informal with it: I follow a trail of bookshelves up a staircase and find myself in her office – there is no door to keep punters out. And the regulars’ loyalty is returned: she likes, she says, to buy her second-hand books from people that she’s known ‘so I can pass on stories to the new owners’.  In this spirit, she shows me a book called Pulled Thread Embroidery, owned by Anne Robertson, a local doctor’s wife who used to sew avidly while doing phone duty for her husband. The couple are now frail and have gone into assisted living. ‘They both spent their lives helping the community,’ Anna says, opening the book. A handsewn sampler falls out. We both exclaim over its prettiness but she firmly replaces it – a gift for the book’s purchaser. Then it’s back to the front desk. The Poetry Festival has deprived me of the coffee and WI cake Anna offers punters; I just hope attendees appreciate my sacrifice.  4 Barter Books, Alnwick   Alnwick Station, Wagon Way Road, 01665 604888; www.barterbooks.co.uk   Stuart Manley was a railway enthusiast running a struggling model train shop in a decommissioned station when his wife, Mary, pointed out that books might sell better. Almost 20 years later, they have most of the huge building and have done it up wonderfully: people lounge around reading before a roaring fire in the old waiting room, while the ticket hall smells most inauthentically of good coffee.  Mary deals with externals, he deals with finance, Stuart says, but the gentle whish of the model railway running above the bookshelves was surely his doing. The place is an extraordinary mixture of the canny and the casual: people turning up with boxes of books to barter (‘our most revolutionary idea was being nice to the customers: we can’t take every book but we can be polite about it’), quotes by Baudelaire and Keats strung between shelves, replica Edwardian lunch boxes full of biscuits for sale, as well as every possible permutation of the Second World War poster Stuart famously found in a box of bartered books. ‘Keep Calm and Carry On’ blares from a red background; the poster was never distributed (the only other known original is in the Imperial War Museum), but when Stuart put it up he was deluged with requests to buy a copy. The proceeds must help the ongoing work on this gargantuan – and listed – building.  Stuart says visiting the bigger Hay shops showed him that his 8,000sq ft was enough, although I don’t believe for a minute he’ll stop there. With the carpets, classical music and first editions ranged in cases along the walls, not to mention the literary figures in the trompe l’oeil mural under the eaves, he and Mary have found a way to marry their twin obsessions for trains and books into a place that’s a haven for geeks, and for those just trying to follow the instructions on the poster.  5 Topping & Company, Ely  9 High Street, 01353 645005; www.toppingbooks.co.uk   There’s a rep from publisher Little, Brown, chatting easily at the cash desk in Robert Topping’s woodlined, book-crammed shop next to Ely Cathedral; many of the bigger stores no longer welcome personal visits, he says, but he has a great relationship with Topping’s.  Like so many of today’s independent booksellers, Topping learnt his trade at Waterstone’s, back before founder Tim Waterstone sold up, when the chain was the most exciting thing to happen to bookselling since the invention of the paperback. But before that, he learnt how not to sell them. ‘I first worked at Foyle’s [in London]. I lasted eight months, which was pretty good – Miss Foyle fired everyone sooner or later.’ But that meant you got lots of responsibility really quickly, because your predecessor had probably been fired shortly before you arrived. There was no external phone line, so ordering a book involved ‘sneaking into the manager’s office and using the phone when no one was looking’.  After that, Waterstone was a revelation. ‘He was a wonderful, inspiring man,’ Topping says wistfully. ‘His shops were crammed with books.’ This is clearly Topping’s highest praise: his own three-floor shop (he has another in Bath) is stuffed with them, albeit in an orderly way. We sit at a table in a window-nook, drinking the coffee that is offered free to customers (except he winces at the word customers: ‘the people who come in here love books. They are friends… supporters… our community’). Why not have a café? ‘I’m too jealous of the space. We’re booksellers, not shop owners, so the coffee is free but if we’re busy it arrives a bit more slowly.’  This being a family concern, the handwritten signs on the elegant wooden bookshelves are by his wife, while his son deals with the internet. Topping is no slouch on the recommendation front, informing me that Rose Tremain’s Trespass will be book of the year, even though such certainty has bitten him on the backside occasionally: when Julian Barnes gave a talk in the shop, he announced to the packed crowd that Arthur & George would win the Booker or he, Robert, would eat his hat; it didn’t.  A few months later, Barnes gave a talk at the other shop, with Topping hoping he would have forgotten his rash support; instead, an enormous cake, ordered by the mischievous author, was wheeled in, and the bookseller – along with everyone else – duly ate it.  6 Wigtown, Dumfries & Galloway  www.wigtownbookfestival.com   If you were to look to the left as you zoomed up the M74 towards Glasgow and the Highlands, and you had Superman vision, you would spot Wigtown, about 85 miles away on a promontory that juts towards Ireland. The broad, gracious main square bears witness to the town’s importance in the 19th century and earlier, but by the Eighties the county seat had moved to Dumfries, the creamery and distillery had closed down and the place bore glum witness to Scotland’s industrial decline.  All of which made it a perfect candidate to win a rather unconventional competition aimed at regeneration through bookshops – which it did, becoming Scotland’s official book town in 1997. Now there are 14 booksellers, lots of painters and decorators driving fancy new cars and a town that is managing, if not quite thriving, through the windy end of a chilly winter. In summer, I’m told, the shops are packed, while September heralds the Wigtown Book Festival, during which marquees go up on bookshop lawns, famous authors take over the biggest bookshop’s drawing room and everyone overdoses on literature and gourmet food.  The rest of the time, bookworms can visit at least six bookshops on the main drag, from Reading Lasses, a bookshop with a female bias (Virago classics, an anthology called I Dream of Madonna and a calendar featuring pert farmers in various stages of undress) and an excellent café with homemade cakes; Byre Books (technically a converted stable, not a byre, and probably only big enough for a Shetland pony at that, but full of interesting tomes on mythology, film, theatre and Scotland); The Bookshop, Wigtown’s (and, according to owner Shaun Bythell, Scotland’s) biggest independent bookshop; The Box of Frogs, a children’s bookshop and gift shop; and The Book End Studio, where Julie Houston juggles a toddler, a cleaning job and her own painting with selling books, art and children’s toys. There is also The Old Bank, which was the customs house at the back and a bank at the front until the directors were jailed in 1878 for ‘uttering false accounts’. This solid, spacious building has a whole roomful of scores, sheet music and songbooks, as well as more general stock and is now run by Helena, age five, with occasional humble contributions from her parents, Joyce and Ian.  Wigtown is such an eccentric spot (‘come into this mad place!’, one owner welcomed me, and she isn’t kidding: within 24 hours someone had offered to sell me a bookshop, and the Wild Goose Chase signs are not a reference to the town’s inaccessibility but to an actual event involving real birds), so ensconced in a mythological bygone era where business fitted around chat and the shop was the bit below the family home, that it did not surprise me at all to find that most of the booksellers don’t do much online. ‘That’s always next year’s project,’ several of them told me – but in Wigtown, I’m not sure next year ever comes.  7 News From Nowhere, Liverpool  96 Bold St, 0151 708 7270; www.newsfromnowhere.org.uk   ‘We are sensitive to all things to do with women and women having a life,’ says Sara, the newbie member (a mere eight years) of the women’s co-op that runs this radical bookshop. If the place had a matriarch, which it doesn’t, being a socialist organisation, then Mandy would fill the role: she has been here since 1976 and has the flowing robes, patient smile and leftist politics you’d expect.  Their computer also looks to have arrived in the mid-Seventies – it even has a flashing cursor. But it can find the internet and the shop does sell online, although this is a real community hub, which is presumably how it survives on a dilapidated high street that has lost out to a big new shopping centre, and that houses two other bookshops. Mandy is unperturbed. ‘It’s better to be near each other,’ she says, ‘it’s handy for people who like browsing bookshops.’  The place is shabby but loved, with a rack of newsletters, a section devoted to violence against women but also lots of fiction and history, particularly Irish (‘we were a major source of information through the Troubles’). They do stock books by men; they also have a children’s corner with world folk tales.  Mandy points out that Liverpool has a history of radicalism and that the shop’s supporters rally around when they get into trouble, offering credit loans against future purchases; and they do a lot with John Moores University.  While I’m there, a young man asks Mandy for a book which has to be ordered from the US. Hearing that there is a copy in, but it’s promised to someone, he offers to pay extra. I watch fascinated as socialist principle confronts the spectre of ravening capitalism (admittedly, in the shape of a guy who wants to get his chum a present). Mandy shakes her head firmly: one small step for mankind.  8 Poetry Bookshop, Hay-on-Wye   Ice House, Brook Street, 01497 821812; www.poetrybookshop.com   The Princes weren’t going to show me the Georgian ice house beneath their little shop in Hay-on-Wye, but I asked about foreign language poetry and that’s stored downstairs.  The enormous brick-lined cylinder, like a giant well, would have been packed with ice; now, thanks to electricity and refrigerators, it’s redundant. Maybe the sheer weirdness of the legendary book town on the Welsh borders, where even the local café’s menu says, ‘Please note: these dishes are prepared in a nutty environment’, is affecting me, but I know I wouldn’t want quite such a majestic symbol of obsolescence beneath my obscure specialist bookshop.  With his long hair and thin grey sweater, Chris looks like a cliché of a poetry obsessive, although actually he was just looking for something to do when this shop came up for sale. With an older, male customer who is threatening to sleep in the field where book festival events take place (the 80,000 visitors have outgrown even the town’s 30-odd bookshops), a lively three-way discussion on old jazz sleevenotes gets under way, soon shading into the inevitable conversation on the future of bookshops.  Chris acknowledges that being a specialist limits both his purchasing possibilities and his customer base but, he says, ‘people like the idea that a poetry bookshop exists. And if you like poetry books – and I know a lot of people can live without them – then it’s wonderful to be in a room with so many.’ He does find the internet threatening because ‘it makes everybody an expert’ and he thinks the Government should subsidise bookshop rents because they bring culture to the high street, which leads to a three-way row: I don’t feel that’s viable.  During this I discover that the customer is not a customer but a published poet. So he may have been serious about kipping in the field.

Britain's best independent bookshops

One has a railway running along its shelves, another displays its wares in a 
  Victorian bath. Small bookshops aren't dead, they're thriving, and we've 
  hunted down the best.

 Oh business – how can people?’ wailed Nancy Mitford while attempting to discuss her share of Mayfair bookshop Heywood Hill in 1948; amazingly, it’s still there, even though the hilarious letters between Mitford and Hill make it clear that when it came to business, these people couldn’t, really.  Any bookseller who requires his own slang term (to couch) for ‘to place in a pile and leave until dust settles or emergency strikes’ was probably never going to die rich.  Then again, if you want business acuity in a bookshop, go to the relevant shelf: it has rarely been found behind the counter. The Net Book Agreement, which precluded discounts until the Nineties, and the absence of any real competition before the internet, meant that until recently practically anyone could make a living (but not a fortune) selling books.  George Orwell, writing in 1936, reckoned that since the corporates would never be able to squeeze independent booksellers the way they had the grocer or the milkman, ‘it is a humane trade which is not capable of being vulgarised beyond a certain point’.  He was wrong about big business – these days, some bookshops are decidedly more equal than others – but while 102 (nearly 10 per cent of the total) closed in 2009, according to the Booksellers Association, there are still independents dotted all over the country, usually in villages and market towns where they help reinforce a sense of community. Which is odd when you consider that reading is one of the most solitary pursuits around  Small bookshops, however, are gregarious: when I set out to find those that were doing well and how they were managing to hold back the tide of so-called progress, I encountered roaring fires, free coffee and regulars who were greeted by name and were happy to talk, especially about books.  I was there in search of personalities – the booksellers, of course, but also the shops themselves, which despite their similarities had, like dogs are said to, come to resemble their owners. No small business is having an easy time at the moment, although the internet actually gives at least as much as it takes away: most of the people I spoke to sell online, find books for customers that way and even order through Amazon for people who don’t want to do so themselves.  In fact, it is publishers who are really causing the small shops trouble by undercutting them. Apparently they don’t see how cannibalistic this is: kill the little businesses and they’ll be entirely at Amazon’s mercy.  Still, for the moment, the death of the independent bookshop has been greatly exaggerated, so I have selected these rather as one chooses books in a good shop: by running my finger along the possibilities, stopping when something catches my fancy and pulling out those that look really enticing for closer examination.  And, as with good fiction, I have been rewarded with a range of unforgettable characters, overcoming great obstacles and devoting their considerable powers of invention to overseeing bookshops that have as little in common with a blank-faced chain outlet as a newsletter does with a novel.  1 Mr B’s Reading Emporium, Bath   14-15 John Street, 01225 331155; www.mrbsemporium.com (pictured)  Down a titchy street just off the main drag is a pine-lined shop that feels spacious but isn’t: owner Nic Bottomley simply doesn’t go for the atmospheric clutter germane to most booklovers. (‘Books give off more and nastier dust than any other class of objects yet invented,’ Orwell grumbled, ‘and the top of a book is the place where every bluebottle prefers to die.’) Nic is also young, blonde, nattily dressed and exceptionally good at publicity, all of which is so uncommon in this trade that I wonder if he took the wrong turning en route to a real job.  Actually, he was a derivatives trader who cut and ran, taking over an antiques shop’s spare showroom in 2006. Now he has teatowels with cleverly altered quotations (‘a single man in possession of a fortune should spend it at Mr B’s’), a Victorian bath covered in books and a reading booth where, for £3.50, you get a comfy chair, headphones, coffee, biscuits and a closed door with a Do Not Disturb sign. His staff are beyond helpful: clearly living the dream with him, and this spirit of togetherness shows in the handwritten recommendations, complete with cartoons (‘we’ve Simpsonised ourselves!’) that dot the shelves.  Ed expounds his theory that clever publishers are making books into ever more desirable objects, and shows me one with a cover that pulls off to become a map and another with ye olde ruffled page edges, to prove it, while Nic deals with a regular who wants a ‘history of something?’ for his wife, pinpointing Andrew Marr’s A History of Modern Britain within a minute, and sending the man wafting out the door on a blast of information about a forthcoming Marr event, like Mary Poppins carried off by the west wind.  Naturally, Nic is an expert internet user with a blog, a sophisticated stock-searching system and a mass of online sales, but he doesn’t fear the beast, partly because he has tamed it (Mexican-American Pulitzer finalist Luis Alberto Urrea is taking time out of a family holiday to give a talk at Mr B’s on the back of Nic’s mini-review of his book on Twitter) and partly because he understands what it cannot give. He sells a reading spa package, which gets you lots of books and a goody bag but also, and more importantly, an extensive chat over coffee and cake with him about your likes and dislikes. It is, arguably, what booksellers do anyway, but it’s very popular, as expert help generally is and probably – people being sociable creatures – always will be.  2 Al Saqi Books, London   26 Westbourne Grove, 020 7229 8543; www.alsaqibookshop.com   Murder One, the crime bookshop has gone; Charing Cross Road resembles a denuded bookshelf, with a couple of forgotten paperbacks still littering its length. Indomitable Foyles remains and the antiquarian bookshops of Cecil Court; elsewhere, independents still glow like candlelight amid the glare of generic high street shops. There are even brave new ventures, such as the kiosk-sized Herne Hill Books and To Hell With Publishing’s boutique near King’s Cross.  In the city that has everything, though, it is the specialists who are thriving: if you are a foodie, you want to visit Books for Cooks in Notting Hill; if you have itchy feet, Stanfords is the place to scratch them; should you want your children reading in an atmosphere congenial to adults, there’s Victoria Park Books in Hackney; while Al Saqi, the Middle Eastern bookshop near Paddington, caters to Arabic speakers and Anglophones interested in the area – as well as an international readership trying to get hold of books that are banned in the countries in which they are written.  Al Saqi (which means ‘the one who gives you water’) was started in 1979 by the Lebanese sculptress and humanitarian activist Mai Ghoussoub (‘words don’t kill – humans do’) and her friend André Gaspard. Since Ghoussoub’s death in 2007, the shop has been run by Gaspard’s wife, Salwa; the English and Arabic publishing arms are run separately but are, Salwa says, ‘like a family tree’.  The shop sells online but suffers from internet discounting, although Amazon hasn’t started selling Arabic language books yet, but what helps is that ‘we’re very academic and very open-minded’ – an unusual combination. This shop, even more than most of these ‘tiny first-class kennels for underdogs’ (Hill’s phrase), is a safe haven for persecuted literature.  3 Wenlock Books, Much Wenlock   12 High Street, 01952 727877; www.wenlockbooks.co.uk   Anna Dreda is trying to sell tickets to her forthcoming Poetry Festival (patron: Carol Ann Duffy) to those too Luddite to buy them online, so she doesn’t have time to talk, but she does. Clearing a space upstairs, among the second-hand stock (downstairs is new), she tells me about reading Women’s Studies at Birmingham, bringing up children, doing youth work until this chance came up 18 years ago and she gave up everything ‘except circle dancing’. The shop, on the adorable high street of this pretty market town, reflects her tastes: one shelf of humour but five of women’s studies and some very eclectic CDs. There’s a travel section up front and the inevitable local interest books, and a loyal local clientele, supplemented by tourists. However, Anna no longer sells on the internet: ‘I was spending time stuffing books into bags and I didn’t buy this place to do that.’  Anna, who created her own surname by truncating her mother’s first name when she got divorced, is clearly strong-minded, but charming and informal with it: I follow a trail of bookshelves up a staircase and find myself in her office – there is no door to keep punters out. And the regulars’ loyalty is returned: she likes, she says, to buy her second-hand books from people that she’s known ‘so I can pass on stories to the new owners’.  In this spirit, she shows me a book called Pulled Thread Embroidery, owned by Anne Robertson, a local doctor’s wife who used to sew avidly while doing phone duty for her husband. The couple are now frail and have gone into assisted living. ‘They both spent their lives helping the community,’ Anna says, opening the book. A handsewn sampler falls out. We both exclaim over its prettiness but she firmly replaces it – a gift for the book’s purchaser. Then it’s back to the front desk. The Poetry Festival has deprived me of the coffee and WI cake Anna offers punters; I just hope attendees appreciate my sacrifice.  4 Barter Books, Alnwick   Alnwick Station, Wagon Way Road, 01665 604888; www.barterbooks.co.uk   Stuart Manley was a railway enthusiast running a struggling model train shop in a decommissioned station when his wife, Mary, pointed out that books might sell better. Almost 20 years later, they have most of the huge building and have done it up wonderfully: people lounge around reading before a roaring fire in the old waiting room, while the ticket hall smells most inauthentically of good coffee.  Mary deals with externals, he deals with finance, Stuart says, but the gentle whish of the model railway running above the bookshelves was surely his doing. The place is an extraordinary mixture of the canny and the casual: people turning up with boxes of books to barter (‘our most revolutionary idea was being nice to the customers: we can’t take every book but we can be polite about it’), quotes by Baudelaire and Keats strung between shelves, replica Edwardian lunch boxes full of biscuits for sale, as well as every possible permutation of the Second World War poster Stuart famously found in a box of bartered books. ‘Keep Calm and Carry On’ blares from a red background; the poster was never distributed (the only other known original is in the Imperial War Museum), but when Stuart put it up he was deluged with requests to buy a copy. The proceeds must help the ongoing work on this gargantuan – and listed – building.  Stuart says visiting the bigger Hay shops showed him that his 8,000sq ft was enough, although I don’t believe for a minute he’ll stop there. With the carpets, classical music and first editions ranged in cases along the walls, not to mention the literary figures in the trompe l’oeil mural under the eaves, he and Mary have found a way to marry their twin obsessions for trains and books into a place that’s a haven for geeks, and for those just trying to follow the instructions on the poster.  5 Topping & Company, Ely  9 High Street, 01353 645005; www.toppingbooks.co.uk   There’s a rep from publisher Little, Brown, chatting easily at the cash desk in Robert Topping’s woodlined, book-crammed shop next to Ely Cathedral; many of the bigger stores no longer welcome personal visits, he says, but he has a great relationship with Topping’s.  Like so many of today’s independent booksellers, Topping learnt his trade at Waterstone’s, back before founder Tim Waterstone sold up, when the chain was the most exciting thing to happen to bookselling since the invention of the paperback. But before that, he learnt how not to sell them. ‘I first worked at Foyle’s [in London]. I lasted eight months, which was pretty good – Miss Foyle fired everyone sooner or later.’ But that meant you got lots of responsibility really quickly, because your predecessor had probably been fired shortly before you arrived. There was no external phone line, so ordering a book involved ‘sneaking into the manager’s office and using the phone when no one was looking’.  After that, Waterstone was a revelation. ‘He was a wonderful, inspiring man,’ Topping says wistfully. ‘His shops were crammed with books.’ This is clearly Topping’s highest praise: his own three-floor shop (he has another in Bath) is stuffed with them, albeit in an orderly way. We sit at a table in a window-nook, drinking the coffee that is offered free to customers (except he winces at the word customers: ‘the people who come in here love books. They are friends… supporters… our community’). Why not have a café? ‘I’m too jealous of the space. We’re booksellers, not shop owners, so the coffee is free but if we’re busy it arrives a bit more slowly.’  This being a family concern, the handwritten signs on the elegant wooden bookshelves are by his wife, while his son deals with the internet. Topping is no slouch on the recommendation front, informing me that Rose Tremain’s Trespass will be book of the year, even though such certainty has bitten him on the backside occasionally: when Julian Barnes gave a talk in the shop, he announced to the packed crowd that Arthur & George would win the Booker or he, Robert, would eat his hat; it didn’t.  A few months later, Barnes gave a talk at the other shop, with Topping hoping he would have forgotten his rash support; instead, an enormous cake, ordered by the mischievous author, was wheeled in, and the bookseller – along with everyone else – duly ate it.  6 Wigtown, Dumfries & Galloway  www.wigtownbookfestival.com   If you were to look to the left as you zoomed up the M74 towards Glasgow and the Highlands, and you had Superman vision, you would spot Wigtown, about 85 miles away on a promontory that juts towards Ireland. The broad, gracious main square bears witness to the town’s importance in the 19th century and earlier, but by the Eighties the county seat had moved to Dumfries, the creamery and distillery had closed down and the place bore glum witness to Scotland’s industrial decline.  All of which made it a perfect candidate to win a rather unconventional competition aimed at regeneration through bookshops – which it did, becoming Scotland’s official book town in 1997. Now there are 14 booksellers, lots of painters and decorators driving fancy new cars and a town that is managing, if not quite thriving, through the windy end of a chilly winter. In summer, I’m told, the shops are packed, while September heralds the Wigtown Book Festival, during which marquees go up on bookshop lawns, famous authors take over the biggest bookshop’s drawing room and everyone overdoses on literature and gourmet food.  The rest of the time, bookworms can visit at least six bookshops on the main drag, from Reading Lasses, a bookshop with a female bias (Virago classics, an anthology called I Dream of Madonna and a calendar featuring pert farmers in various stages of undress) and an excellent café with homemade cakes; Byre Books (technically a converted stable, not a byre, and probably only big enough for a Shetland pony at that, but full of interesting tomes on mythology, film, theatre and Scotland); The Bookshop, Wigtown’s (and, according to owner Shaun Bythell, Scotland’s) biggest independent bookshop; The Box of Frogs, a children’s bookshop and gift shop; and The Book End Studio, where Julie Houston juggles a toddler, a cleaning job and her own painting with selling books, art and children’s toys. There is also The Old Bank, which was the customs house at the back and a bank at the front until the directors were jailed in 1878 for ‘uttering false accounts’. This solid, spacious building has a whole roomful of scores, sheet music and songbooks, as well as more general stock and is now run by Helena, age five, with occasional humble contributions from her parents, Joyce and Ian.  Wigtown is such an eccentric spot (‘come into this mad place!’, one owner welcomed me, and she isn’t kidding: within 24 hours someone had offered to sell me a bookshop, and the Wild Goose Chase signs are not a reference to the town’s inaccessibility but to an actual event involving real birds), so ensconced in a mythological bygone era where business fitted around chat and the shop was the bit below the family home, that it did not surprise me at all to find that most of the booksellers don’t do much online. ‘That’s always next year’s project,’ several of them told me – but in Wigtown, I’m not sure next year ever comes.  7 News From Nowhere, Liverpool  96 Bold St, 0151 708 7270; www.newsfromnowhere.org.uk   ‘We are sensitive to all things to do with women and women having a life,’ says Sara, the newbie member (a mere eight years) of the women’s co-op that runs this radical bookshop. If the place had a matriarch, which it doesn’t, being a socialist organisation, then Mandy would fill the role: she has been here since 1976 and has the flowing robes, patient smile and leftist politics you’d expect.  Their computer also looks to have arrived in the mid-Seventies – it even has a flashing cursor. But it can find the internet and the shop does sell online, although this is a real community hub, which is presumably how it survives on a dilapidated high street that has lost out to a big new shopping centre, and that houses two other bookshops. Mandy is unperturbed. ‘It’s better to be near each other,’ she says, ‘it’s handy for people who like browsing bookshops.’  The place is shabby but loved, with a rack of newsletters, a section devoted to violence against women but also lots of fiction and history, particularly Irish (‘we were a major source of information through the Troubles’). They do stock books by men; they also have a children’s corner with world folk tales.  Mandy points out that Liverpool has a history of radicalism and that the shop’s supporters rally around when they get into trouble, offering credit loans against future purchases; and they do a lot with John Moores University.  While I’m there, a young man asks Mandy for a book which has to be ordered from the US. Hearing that there is a copy in, but it’s promised to someone, he offers to pay extra. I watch fascinated as socialist principle confronts the spectre of ravening capitalism (admittedly, in the shape of a guy who wants to get his chum a present). Mandy shakes her head firmly: one small step for mankind.  8 Poetry Bookshop, Hay-on-Wye   Ice House, Brook Street, 01497 821812; www.poetrybookshop.com   The Princes weren’t going to show me the Georgian ice house beneath their little shop in Hay-on-Wye, but I asked about foreign language poetry and that’s stored downstairs.  The enormous brick-lined cylinder, like a giant well, would have been packed with ice; now, thanks to electricity and refrigerators, it’s redundant. Maybe the sheer weirdness of the legendary book town on the Welsh borders, where even the local café’s menu says, ‘Please note: these dishes are prepared in a nutty environment’, is affecting me, but I know I wouldn’t want quite such a majestic symbol of obsolescence beneath my obscure specialist bookshop.  With his long hair and thin grey sweater, Chris looks like a cliché of a poetry obsessive, although actually he was just looking for something to do when this shop came up for sale. With an older, male customer who is threatening to sleep in the field where book festival events take place (the 80,000 visitors have outgrown even the town’s 30-odd bookshops), a lively three-way discussion on old jazz sleevenotes gets under way, soon shading into the inevitable conversation on the future of bookshops.  Chris acknowledges that being a specialist limits both his purchasing possibilities and his customer base but, he says, ‘people like the idea that a poetry bookshop exists. And if you like poetry books – and I know a lot of people can live without them – then it’s wonderful to be in a room with so many.’ He does find the internet threatening because ‘it makes everybody an expert’ and he thinks the Government should subsidise bookshop rents because they bring culture to the high street, which leads to a three-way row: I don’t feel that’s viable.  During this I discover that the customer is not a customer but a published poet. So he may have been serious about kipping in the field.

Britain's best independent bookshops

One has a railway running along its shelves, another displays its wares in a 
  Victorian bath. Small bookshops aren't dead, they're thriving, and we've 
  hunted down the best.

1:15PM BST 20 Apr 2010
 


 Oh business – how can people?’ wailed Nancy Mitford while attempting to discuss her share of Mayfair bookshop Heywood Hill in 1948; amazingly, it’s still there, even though the hilarious letters between Mitford and Hill make it clear that when it came to business, these people couldn’t, really.  Any bookseller who requires his own slang term (to couch) for ‘to place in a pile and leave until dust settles or emergency strikes’ was probably never going to die rich.  Then again, if you want business acuity in a bookshop, go to the relevant shelf: it has rarely been found behind the counter. The Net Book Agreement, which precluded discounts until the Nineties, and the absence of any real competition before the internet, meant that until recently practically anyone could make a living (but not a fortune) selling books.  George Orwell, writing in 1936, reckoned that since the corporates would never be able to squeeze independent booksellers the way they had the grocer or the milkman, ‘it is a humane trade which is not capable of being vulgarised beyond a certain point’.  He was wrong about big business – these days, some bookshops are decidedly more equal than others – but while 102 (nearly 10 per cent of the total) closed in 2009, according to the Booksellers Association, there are still independents dotted all over the country, usually in villages and market towns where they help reinforce a sense of community. Which is odd when you consider that reading is one of the most solitary pursuits around  Small bookshops, however, are gregarious: when I set out to find those that were doing well and how they were managing to hold back the tide of so-called progress, I encountered roaring fires, free coffee and regulars who were greeted by name and were happy to talk, especially about books.  I was there in search of personalities – the booksellers, of course, but also the shops themselves, which despite their similarities had, like dogs are said to, come to resemble their owners. No small business is having an easy time at the moment, although the internet actually gives at least as much as it takes away: most of the people I spoke to sell online, find books for customers that way and even order through Amazon for people who don’t want to do so themselves.  In fact, it is publishers who are really causing the small shops trouble by undercutting them. Apparently they don’t see how cannibalistic this is: kill the little businesses and they’ll be entirely at Amazon’s mercy.  Still, for the moment, the death of the independent bookshop has been greatly exaggerated, so I have selected these rather as one chooses books in a good shop: by running my finger along the possibilities, stopping when something catches my fancy and pulling out those that look really enticing for closer examination.  And, as with good fiction, I have been rewarded with a range of unforgettable characters, overcoming great obstacles and devoting their considerable powers of invention to overseeing bookshops that have as little in common with a blank-faced chain outlet as a newsletter does with a novel.  1 Mr B’s Reading Emporium, Bath   14-15 John Street, 01225 331155; www.mrbsemporium.com (pictured)  Down a titchy street just off the main drag is a pine-lined shop that feels spacious but isn’t: owner Nic Bottomley simply doesn’t go for the atmospheric clutter germane to most booklovers. (‘Books give off more and nastier dust than any other class of objects yet invented,’ Orwell grumbled, ‘and the top of a book is the place where every bluebottle prefers to die.’) Nic is also young, blonde, nattily dressed and exceptionally good at publicity, all of which is so uncommon in this trade that I wonder if he took the wrong turning en route to a real job.  Actually, he was a derivatives trader who cut and ran, taking over an antiques shop’s spare showroom in 2006. Now he has teatowels with cleverly altered quotations (‘a single man in possession of a fortune should spend it at Mr B’s’), a Victorian bath covered in books and a reading booth where, for £3.50, you get a comfy chair, headphones, coffee, biscuits and a closed door with a Do Not Disturb sign. His staff are beyond helpful: clearly living the dream with him, and this spirit of togetherness shows in the handwritten recommendations, complete with cartoons (‘we’ve Simpsonised ourselves!’) that dot the shelves.  Ed expounds his theory that clever publishers are making books into ever more desirable objects, and shows me one with a cover that pulls off to become a map and another with ye olde ruffled page edges, to prove it, while Nic deals with a regular who wants a ‘history of something?’ for his wife, pinpointing Andrew Marr’s A History of Modern Britain within a minute, and sending the man wafting out the door on a blast of information about a forthcoming Marr event, like Mary Poppins carried off by the west wind.  Naturally, Nic is an expert internet user with a blog, a sophisticated stock-searching system and a mass of online sales, but he doesn’t fear the beast, partly because he has tamed it (Mexican-American Pulitzer finalist Luis Alberto Urrea is taking time out of a family holiday to give a talk at Mr B’s on the back of Nic’s mini-review of his book on Twitter) and partly because he understands what it cannot give. He sells a reading spa package, which gets you lots of books and a goody bag but also, and more importantly, an extensive chat over coffee and cake with him about your likes and dislikes. It is, arguably, what booksellers do anyway, but it’s very popular, as expert help generally is and probably – people being sociable creatures – always will be.  2 Al Saqi Books, London   26 Westbourne Grove, 020 7229 8543; www.alsaqibookshop.com   Murder One, the crime bookshop has gone; Charing Cross Road resembles a denuded bookshelf, with a couple of forgotten paperbacks still littering its length. Indomitable Foyles remains and the antiquarian bookshops of Cecil Court; elsewhere, independents still glow like candlelight amid the glare of generic high street shops. There are even brave new ventures, such as the kiosk-sized Herne Hill Books and To Hell With Publishing’s boutique near King’s Cross.  In the city that has everything, though, it is the specialists who are thriving: if you are a foodie, you want to visit Books for Cooks in Notting Hill; if you have itchy feet, Stanfords is the place to scratch them; should you want your children reading in an atmosphere congenial to adults, there’s Victoria Park Books in Hackney; while Al Saqi, the Middle Eastern bookshop near Paddington, caters to Arabic speakers and Anglophones interested in the area – as well as an international readership trying to get hold of books that are banned in the countries in which they are written.  Al Saqi (which means ‘the one who gives you water’) was started in 1979 by the Lebanese sculptress and humanitarian activist Mai Ghoussoub (‘words don’t kill – humans do’) and her friend André Gaspard. Since Ghoussoub’s death in 2007, the shop has been run by Gaspard’s wife, Salwa; the English and Arabic publishing arms are run separately but are, Salwa says, ‘like a family tree’.  The shop sells online but suffers from internet discounting, although Amazon hasn’t started selling Arabic language books yet, but what helps is that ‘we’re very academic and very open-minded’ – an unusual combination. This shop, even more than most of these ‘tiny first-class kennels for underdogs’ (Hill’s phrase), is a safe haven for persecuted literature.  3 Wenlock Books, Much Wenlock   12 High Street, 01952 727877; www.wenlockbooks.co.uk   Anna Dreda is trying to sell tickets to her forthcoming Poetry Festival (patron: Carol Ann Duffy) to those too Luddite to buy them online, so she doesn’t have time to talk, but she does. Clearing a space upstairs, among the second-hand stock (downstairs is new), she tells me about reading Women’s Studies at Birmingham, bringing up children, doing youth work until this chance came up 18 years ago and she gave up everything ‘except circle dancing’. The shop, on the adorable high street of this pretty market town, reflects her tastes: one shelf of humour but five of women’s studies and some very eclectic CDs. There’s a travel section up front and the inevitable local interest books, and a loyal local clientele, supplemented by tourists. However, Anna no longer sells on the internet: ‘I was spending time stuffing books into bags and I didn’t buy this place to do that.’  Anna, who created her own surname by truncating her mother’s first name when she got divorced, is clearly strong-minded, but charming and informal with it: I follow a trail of bookshelves up a staircase and find myself in her office – there is no door to keep punters out. And the regulars’ loyalty is returned: she likes, she says, to buy her second-hand books from people that she’s known ‘so I can pass on stories to the new owners’.  In this spirit, she shows me a book called Pulled Thread Embroidery, owned by Anne Robertson, a local doctor’s wife who used to sew avidly while doing phone duty for her husband. The couple are now frail and have gone into assisted living. ‘They both spent their lives helping the community,’ Anna says, opening the book. A handsewn sampler falls out. We both exclaim over its prettiness but she firmly replaces it – a gift for the book’s purchaser. Then it’s back to the front desk. The Poetry Festival has deprived me of the coffee and WI cake Anna offers punters; I just hope attendees appreciate my sacrifice.  4 Barter Books, Alnwick   Alnwick Station, Wagon Way Road, 01665 604888; www.barterbooks.co.uk   Stuart Manley was a railway enthusiast running a struggling model train shop in a decommissioned station when his wife, Mary, pointed out that books might sell better. Almost 20 years later, they have most of the huge building and have done it up wonderfully: people lounge around reading before a roaring fire in the old waiting room, while the ticket hall smells most inauthentically of good coffee.  Mary deals with externals, he deals with finance, Stuart says, but the gentle whish of the model railway running above the bookshelves was surely his doing. The place is an extraordinary mixture of the canny and the casual: people turning up with boxes of books to barter (‘our most revolutionary idea was being nice to the customers: we can’t take every book but we can be polite about it’), quotes by Baudelaire and Keats strung between shelves, replica Edwardian lunch boxes full of biscuits for sale, as well as every possible permutation of the Second World War poster Stuart famously found in a box of bartered books. ‘Keep Calm and Carry On’ blares from a red background; the poster was never distributed (the only other known original is in the Imperial War Museum), but when Stuart put it up he was deluged with requests to buy a copy. The proceeds must help the ongoing work on this gargantuan – and listed – building.  Stuart says visiting the bigger Hay shops showed him that his 8,000sq ft was enough, although I don’t believe for a minute he’ll stop there. With the carpets, classical music and first editions ranged in cases along the walls, not to mention the literary figures in the trompe l’oeil mural under the eaves, he and Mary have found a way to marry their twin obsessions for trains and books into a place that’s a haven for geeks, and for those just trying to follow the instructions on the poster.  5 Topping & Company, Ely  9 High Street, 01353 645005; www.toppingbooks.co.uk   There’s a rep from publisher Little, Brown, chatting easily at the cash desk in Robert Topping’s woodlined, book-crammed shop next to Ely Cathedral; many of the bigger stores no longer welcome personal visits, he says, but he has a great relationship with Topping’s.  Like so many of today’s independent booksellers, Topping learnt his trade at Waterstone’s, back before founder Tim Waterstone sold up, when the chain was the most exciting thing to happen to bookselling since the invention of the paperback. But before that, he learnt how not to sell them. ‘I first worked at Foyle’s [in London]. I lasted eight months, which was pretty good – Miss Foyle fired everyone sooner or later.’ But that meant you got lots of responsibility really quickly, because your predecessor had probably been fired shortly before you arrived. There was no external phone line, so ordering a book involved ‘sneaking into the manager’s office and using the phone when no one was looking’.  After that, Waterstone was a revelation. ‘He was a wonderful, inspiring man,’ Topping says wistfully. ‘His shops were crammed with books.’ This is clearly Topping’s highest praise: his own three-floor shop (he has another in Bath) is stuffed with them, albeit in an orderly way. We sit at a table in a window-nook, drinking the coffee that is offered free to customers (except he winces at the word customers: ‘the people who come in here love books. They are friends… supporters… our community’). Why not have a café? ‘I’m too jealous of the space. We’re booksellers, not shop owners, so the coffee is free but if we’re busy it arrives a bit more slowly.’  This being a family concern, the handwritten signs on the elegant wooden bookshelves are by his wife, while his son deals with the internet. Topping is no slouch on the recommendation front, informing me that Rose Tremain’s Trespass will be book of the year, even though such certainty has bitten him on the backside occasionally: when Julian Barnes gave a talk in the shop, he announced to the packed crowd that Arthur & George would win the Booker or he, Robert, would eat his hat; it didn’t.  A few months later, Barnes gave a talk at the other shop, with Topping hoping he would have forgotten his rash support; instead, an enormous cake, ordered by the mischievous author, was wheeled in, and the bookseller – along with everyone else – duly ate it.  6 Wigtown, Dumfries & Galloway  www.wigtownbookfestival.com   If you were to look to the left as you zoomed up the M74 towards Glasgow and the Highlands, and you had Superman vision, you would spot Wigtown, about 85 miles away on a promontory that juts towards Ireland. The broad, gracious main square bears witness to the town’s importance in the 19th century and earlier, but by the Eighties the county seat had moved to Dumfries, the creamery and distillery had closed down and the place bore glum witness to Scotland’s industrial decline.  All of which made it a perfect candidate to win a rather unconventional competition aimed at regeneration through bookshops – which it did, becoming Scotland’s official book town in 1997. Now there are 14 booksellers, lots of painters and decorators driving fancy new cars and a town that is managing, if not quite thriving, through the windy end of a chilly winter. In summer, I’m told, the shops are packed, while September heralds the Wigtown Book Festival, during which marquees go up on bookshop lawns, famous authors take over the biggest bookshop’s drawing room and everyone overdoses on literature and gourmet food.  The rest of the time, bookworms can visit at least six bookshops on the main drag, from Reading Lasses, a bookshop with a female bias (Virago classics, an anthology called I Dream of Madonna and a calendar featuring pert farmers in various stages of undress) and an excellent café with homemade cakes; Byre Books (technically a converted stable, not a byre, and probably only big enough for a Shetland pony at that, but full of interesting tomes on mythology, film, theatre and Scotland); The Bookshop, Wigtown’s (and, according to owner Shaun Bythell, Scotland’s) biggest independent bookshop; The Box of Frogs, a children’s bookshop and gift shop; and The Book End Studio, where Julie Houston juggles a toddler, a cleaning job and her own painting with selling books, art and children’s toys. There is also The Old Bank, which was the customs house at the back and a bank at the front until the directors were jailed in 1878 for ‘uttering false accounts’. This solid, spacious building has a whole roomful of scores, sheet music and songbooks, as well as more general stock and is now run by Helena, age five, with occasional humble contributions from her parents, Joyce and Ian.  Wigtown is such an eccentric spot (‘come into this mad place!’, one owner welcomed me, and she isn’t kidding: within 24 hours someone had offered to sell me a bookshop, and the Wild Goose Chase signs are not a reference to the town’s inaccessibility but to an actual event involving real birds), so ensconced in a mythological bygone era where business fitted around chat and the shop was the bit below the family home, that it did not surprise me at all to find that most of the booksellers don’t do much online. ‘That’s always next year’s project,’ several of them told me – but in Wigtown, I’m not sure next year ever comes.  7 News From Nowhere, Liverpool  96 Bold St, 0151 708 7270; www.newsfromnowhere.org.uk   ‘We are sensitive to all things to do with women and women having a life,’ says Sara, the newbie member (a mere eight years) of the women’s co-op that runs this radical bookshop. If the place had a matriarch, which it doesn’t, being a socialist organisation, then Mandy would fill the role: she has been here since 1976 and has the flowing robes, patient smile and leftist politics you’d expect.  Their computer also looks to have arrived in the mid-Seventies – it even has a flashing cursor. But it can find the internet and the shop does sell online, although this is a real community hub, which is presumably how it survives on a dilapidated high street that has lost out to a big new shopping centre, and that houses two other bookshops. Mandy is unperturbed. ‘It’s better to be near each other,’ she says, ‘it’s handy for people who like browsing bookshops.’  The place is shabby but loved, with a rack of newsletters, a section devoted to violence against women but also lots of fiction and history, particularly Irish (‘we were a major source of information through the Troubles’). They do stock books by men; they also have a children’s corner with world folk tales.  Mandy points out that Liverpool has a history of radicalism and that the shop’s supporters rally around when they get into trouble, offering credit loans against future purchases; and they do a lot with John Moores University.  While I’m there, a young man asks Mandy for a book which has to be ordered from the US. Hearing that there is a copy in, but it’s promised to someone, he offers to pay extra. I watch fascinated as socialist principle confronts the spectre of ravening capitalism (admittedly, in the shape of a guy who wants to get his chum a present). Mandy shakes her head firmly: one small step for mankind.  8 Poetry Bookshop, Hay-on-Wye   Ice House, Brook Street, 01497 821812; www.poetrybookshop.com   The Princes weren’t going to show me the Georgian ice house beneath their little shop in Hay-on-Wye, but I asked about foreign language poetry and that’s stored downstairs.  The enormous brick-lined cylinder, like a giant well, would have been packed with ice; now, thanks to electricity and refrigerators, it’s redundant. Maybe the sheer weirdness of the legendary book town on the Welsh borders, where even the local café’s menu says, ‘Please note: these dishes are prepared in a nutty environment’, is affecting me, but I know I wouldn’t want quite such a majestic symbol of obsolescence beneath my obscure specialist bookshop.  With his long hair and thin grey sweater, Chris looks like a cliché of a poetry obsessive, although actually he was just looking for something to do when this shop came up for sale. With an older, male customer who is threatening to sleep in the field where book festival events take place (the 80,000 visitors have outgrown even the town’s 30-odd bookshops), a lively three-way discussion on old jazz sleevenotes gets under way, soon shading into the inevitable conversation on the future of bookshops.  Chris acknowledges that being a specialist limits both his purchasing possibilities and his customer base but, he says, ‘people like the idea that a poetry bookshop exists. And if you like poetry books – and I know a lot of people can live without them – then it’s wonderful to be in a room with so many.’ He does find the internet threatening because ‘it makes everybody an expert’ and he thinks the Government should subsidise bookshop rents because they bring culture to the high street, which leads to a three-way row: I don’t feel that’s viable.  During this I discover that the customer is not a customer but a published poet. So he may have been serious about kipping in the field.

Britain's best independent bookshops

One has a railway running along its shelves, another displays its wares in a 
  Victorian bath. Small bookshops aren't dead, they're thriving, and we've 
  hunted down the best.

1:15PM BST 20 Apr 2010
 


 Oh business – how can people?’ wailed Nancy Mitford while attempting to discuss her share of Mayfair bookshop Heywood Hill in 1948; amazingly, it’s still there, even though the hilarious letters between Mitford and Hill make it clear that when it came to business, these people couldn’t, really.  Any bookseller who requires his own slang term (to couch) for ‘to place in a pile and leave until dust settles or emergency strikes’ was probably never going to die rich.  Then again, if you want business acuity in a bookshop, go to the relevant shelf: it has rarely been found behind the counter. The Net Book Agreement, which precluded discounts until the Nineties, and the absence of any real competition before the internet, meant that until recently practically anyone could make a living (but not a fortune) selling books.  George Orwell, writing in 1936, reckoned that since the corporates would never be able to squeeze independent booksellers the way they had the grocer or the milkman, ‘it is a humane trade which is not capable of being vulgarised beyond a certain point’.  He was wrong about big business – these days, some bookshops are decidedly more equal than others – but while 102 (nearly 10 per cent of the total) closed in 2009, according to the Booksellers Association, there are still independents dotted all over the country, usually in villages and market towns where they help reinforce a sense of community. Which is odd when you consider that reading is one of the most solitary pursuits around  Small bookshops, however, are gregarious: when I set out to find those that were doing well and how they were managing to hold back the tide of so-called progress, I encountered roaring fires, free coffee and regulars who were greeted by name and were happy to talk, especially about books.  I was there in search of personalities – the booksellers, of course, but also the shops themselves, which despite their similarities had, like dogs are said to, come to resemble their owners. No small business is having an easy time at the moment, although the internet actually gives at least as much as it takes away: most of the people I spoke to sell online, find books for customers that way and even order through Amazon for people who don’t want to do so themselves.  In fact, it is publishers who are really causing the small shops trouble by undercutting them. Apparently they don’t see how cannibalistic this is: kill the little businesses and they’ll be entirely at Amazon’s mercy.  Still, for the moment, the death of the independent bookshop has been greatly exaggerated, so I have selected these rather as one chooses books in a good shop: by running my finger along the possibilities, stopping when something catches my fancy and pulling out those that look really enticing for closer examination.  And, as with good fiction, I have been rewarded with a range of unforgettable characters, overcoming great obstacles and devoting their considerable powers of invention to overseeing bookshops that have as little in common with a blank-faced chain outlet as a newsletter does with a novel.  1 Mr B’s Reading Emporium, Bath   14-15 John Street, 01225 331155; www.mrbsemporium.com (pictured)  Down a titchy street just off the main drag is a pine-lined shop that feels spacious but isn’t: owner Nic Bottomley simply doesn’t go for the atmospheric clutter germane to most booklovers. (‘Books give off more and nastier dust than any other class of objects yet invented,’ Orwell grumbled, ‘and the top of a book is the place where every bluebottle prefers to die.’) Nic is also young, blonde, nattily dressed and exceptionally good at publicity, all of which is so uncommon in this trade that I wonder if he took the wrong turning en route to a real job.  Actually, he was a derivatives trader who cut and ran, taking over an antiques shop’s spare showroom in 2006. Now he has teatowels with cleverly altered quotations (‘a single man in possession of a fortune should spend it at Mr B’s’), a Victorian bath covered in books and a reading booth where, for £3.50, you get a comfy chair, headphones, coffee, biscuits and a closed door with a Do Not Disturb sign. His staff are beyond helpful: clearly living the dream with him, and this spirit of togetherness shows in the handwritten recommendations, complete with cartoons (‘we’ve Simpsonised ourselves!’) that dot the shelves.  Ed expounds his theory that clever publishers are making books into ever more desirable objects, and shows me one with a cover that pulls off to become a map and another with ye olde ruffled page edges, to prove it, while Nic deals with a regular who wants a ‘history of something?’ for his wife, pinpointing Andrew Marr’s A History of Modern Britain within a minute, and sending the man wafting out the door on a blast of information about a forthcoming Marr event, like Mary Poppins carried off by the west wind.  Naturally, Nic is an expert internet user with a blog, a sophisticated stock-searching system and a mass of online sales, but he doesn’t fear the beast, partly because he has tamed it (Mexican-American Pulitzer finalist Luis Alberto Urrea is taking time out of a family holiday to give a talk at Mr B’s on the back of Nic’s mini-review of his book on Twitter) and partly because he understands what it cannot give. He sells a reading spa package, which gets you lots of books and a goody bag but also, and more importantly, an extensive chat over coffee and cake with him about your likes and dislikes. It is, arguably, what booksellers do anyway, but it’s very popular, as expert help generally is and probably – people being sociable creatures – always will be.  2 Al Saqi Books, London   26 Westbourne Grove, 020 7229 8543; www.alsaqibookshop.com   Murder One, the crime bookshop has gone; Charing Cross Road resembles a denuded bookshelf, with a couple of forgotten paperbacks still littering its length. Indomitable Foyles remains and the antiquarian bookshops of Cecil Court; elsewhere, independents still glow like candlelight amid the glare of generic high street shops. There are even brave new ventures, such as the kiosk-sized Herne Hill Books and To Hell With Publishing’s boutique near King’s Cross.  In the city that has everything, though, it is the specialists who are thriving: if you are a foodie, you want to visit Books for Cooks in Notting Hill; if you have itchy feet, Stanfords is the place to scratch them; should you want your children reading in an atmosphere congenial to adults, there’s Victoria Park Books in Hackney; while Al Saqi, the Middle Eastern bookshop near Paddington, caters to Arabic speakers and Anglophones interested in the area – as well as an international readership trying to get hold of books that are banned in the countries in which they are written.  Al Saqi (which means ‘the one who gives you water’) was started in 1979 by the Lebanese sculptress and humanitarian activist Mai Ghoussoub (‘words don’t kill – humans do’) and her friend André Gaspard. Since Ghoussoub’s death in 2007, the shop has been run by Gaspard’s wife, Salwa; the English and Arabic publishing arms are run separately but are, Salwa says, ‘like a family tree’.  The shop sells online but suffers from internet discounting, although Amazon hasn’t started selling Arabic language books yet, but what helps is that ‘we’re very academic and very open-minded’ – an unusual combination. This shop, even more than most of these ‘tiny first-class kennels for underdogs’ (Hill’s phrase), is a safe haven for persecuted literature.  3 Wenlock Books, Much Wenlock   12 High Street, 01952 727877; www.wenlockbooks.co.uk   Anna Dreda is trying to sell tickets to her forthcoming Poetry Festival (patron: Carol Ann Duffy) to those too Luddite to buy them online, so she doesn’t have time to talk, but she does. Clearing a space upstairs, among the second-hand stock (downstairs is new), she tells me about reading Women’s Studies at Birmingham, bringing up children, doing youth work until this chance came up 18 years ago and she gave up everything ‘except circle dancing’. The shop, on the adorable high street of this pretty market town, reflects her tastes: one shelf of humour but five of women’s studies and some very eclectic CDs. There’s a travel section up front and the inevitable local interest books, and a loyal local clientele, supplemented by tourists. However, Anna no longer sells on the internet: ‘I was spending time stuffing books into bags and I didn’t buy this place to do that.’  Anna, who created her own surname by truncating her mother’s first name when she got divorced, is clearly strong-minded, but charming and informal with it: I follow a trail of bookshelves up a staircase and find myself in her office – there is no door to keep punters out. And the regulars’ loyalty is returned: she likes, she says, to buy her second-hand books from people that she’s known ‘so I can pass on stories to the new owners’.  In this spirit, she shows me a book called Pulled Thread Embroidery, owned by Anne Robertson, a local doctor’s wife who used to sew avidly while doing phone duty for her husband. The couple are now frail and have gone into assisted living. ‘They both spent their lives helping the community,’ Anna says, opening the book. A handsewn sampler falls out. We both exclaim over its prettiness but she firmly replaces it – a gift for the book’s purchaser. Then it’s back to the front desk. The Poetry Festival has deprived me of the coffee and WI cake Anna offers punters; I just hope attendees appreciate my sacrifice.  4 Barter Books, Alnwick   Alnwick Station, Wagon Way Road, 01665 604888; www.barterbooks.co.uk   Stuart Manley was a railway enthusiast running a struggling model train shop in a decommissioned station when his wife, Mary, pointed out that books might sell better. Almost 20 years later, they have most of the huge building and have done it up wonderfully: people lounge around reading before a roaring fire in the old waiting room, while the ticket hall smells most inauthentically of good coffee.  Mary deals with externals, he deals with finance, Stuart says, but the gentle whish of the model railway running above the bookshelves was surely his doing. The place is an extraordinary mixture of the canny and the casual: people turning up with boxes of books to barter (‘our most revolutionary idea was being nice to the customers: we can’t take every book but we can be polite about it’), quotes by Baudelaire and Keats strung between shelves, replica Edwardian lunch boxes full of biscuits for sale, as well as every possible permutation of the Second World War poster Stuart famously found in a box of bartered books. ‘Keep Calm and Carry On’ blares from a red background; the poster was never distributed (the only other known original is in the Imperial War Museum), but when Stuart put it up he was deluged with requests to buy a copy. The proceeds must help the ongoing work on this gargantuan – and listed – building.  Stuart says visiting the bigger Hay shops showed him that his 8,000sq ft was enough, although I don’t believe for a minute he’ll stop there. With the carpets, classical music and first editions ranged in cases along the walls, not to mention the literary figures in the trompe l’oeil mural under the eaves, he and Mary have found a way to marry their twin obsessions for trains and books into a place that’s a haven for geeks, and for those just trying to follow the instructions on the poster.  5 Topping & Company, Ely  9 High Street, 01353 645005; www.toppingbooks.co.uk   There’s a rep from publisher Little, Brown, chatting easily at the cash desk in Robert Topping’s woodlined, book-crammed shop next to Ely Cathedral; many of the bigger stores no longer welcome personal visits, he says, but he has a great relationship with Topping’s.  Like so many of today’s independent booksellers, Topping learnt his trade at Waterstone’s, back before founder Tim Waterstone sold up, when the chain was the most exciting thing to happen to bookselling since the invention of the paperback. But before that, he learnt how not to sell them. ‘I first worked at Foyle’s [in London]. I lasted eight months, which was pretty good – Miss Foyle fired everyone sooner or later.’ But that meant you got lots of responsibility really quickly, because your predecessor had probably been fired shortly before you arrived. There was no external phone line, so ordering a book involved ‘sneaking into the manager’s office and using the phone when no one was looking’.  After that, Waterstone was a revelation. ‘He was a wonderful, inspiring man,’ Topping says wistfully. ‘His shops were crammed with books.’ This is clearly Topping’s highest praise: his own three-floor shop (he has another in Bath) is stuffed with them, albeit in an orderly way. We sit at a table in a window-nook, drinking the coffee that is offered free to customers (except he winces at the word customers: ‘the people who come in here love books. They are friends… supporters… our community’). Why not have a café? ‘I’m too jealous of the space. We’re booksellers, not shop owners, so the coffee is free but if we’re busy it arrives a bit more slowly.’  This being a family concern, the handwritten signs on the elegant wooden bookshelves are by his wife, while his son deals with the internet. Topping is no slouch on the recommendation front, informing me that Rose Tremain’s Trespass will be book of the year, even though such certainty has bitten him on the backside occasionally: when Julian Barnes gave a talk in the shop, he announced to the packed crowd that Arthur & George would win the Booker or he, Robert, would eat his hat; it didn’t.  A few months later, Barnes gave a talk at the other shop, with Topping hoping he would have forgotten his rash support; instead, an enormous cake, ordered by the mischievous author, was wheeled in, and the bookseller – along with everyone else – duly ate it.  6 Wigtown, Dumfries & Galloway  www.wigtownbookfestival.com   If you were to look to the left as you zoomed up the M74 towards Glasgow and the Highlands, and you had Superman vision, you would spot Wigtown, about 85 miles away on a promontory that juts towards Ireland. The broad, gracious main square bears witness to the town’s importance in the 19th century and earlier, but by the Eighties the county seat had moved to Dumfries, the creamery and distillery had closed down and the place bore glum witness to Scotland’s industrial decline.  All of which made it a perfect candidate to win a rather unconventional competition aimed at regeneration through bookshops – which it did, becoming Scotland’s official book town in 1997. Now there are 14 booksellers, lots of painters and decorators driving fancy new cars and a town that is managing, if not quite thriving, through the windy end of a chilly winter. In summer, I’m told, the shops are packed, while September heralds the Wigtown Book Festival, during which marquees go up on bookshop lawns, famous authors take over the biggest bookshop’s drawing room and everyone overdoses on literature and gourmet food.  The rest of the time, bookworms can visit at least six bookshops on the main drag, from Reading Lasses, a bookshop with a female bias (Virago classics, an anthology called I Dream of Madonna and a calendar featuring pert farmers in various stages of undress) and an excellent café with homemade cakes; Byre Books (technically a converted stable, not a byre, and probably only big enough for a Shetland pony at that, but full of interesting tomes on mythology, film, theatre and Scotland); The Bookshop, Wigtown’s (and, according to owner Shaun Bythell, Scotland’s) biggest independent bookshop; The Box of Frogs, a children’s bookshop and gift shop; and The Book End Studio, where Julie Houston juggles a toddler, a cleaning job and her own painting with selling books, art and children’s toys. There is also The Old Bank, which was the customs house at the back and a bank at the front until the directors were jailed in 1878 for ‘uttering false accounts’. This solid, spacious building has a whole roomful of scores, sheet music and songbooks, as well as more general stock and is now run by Helena, age five, with occasional humble contributions from her parents, Joyce and Ian.  Wigtown is such an eccentric spot (‘come into this mad place!’, one owner welcomed me, and she isn’t kidding: within 24 hours someone had offered to sell me a bookshop, and the Wild Goose Chase signs are not a reference to the town’s inaccessibility but to an actual event involving real birds), so ensconced in a mythological bygone era where business fitted around chat and the shop was the bit below the family home, that it did not surprise me at all to find that most of the booksellers don’t do much online. ‘That’s always next year’s project,’ several of them told me – but in Wigtown, I’m not sure next year ever comes.  7 News From Nowhere, Liverpool  96 Bold St, 0151 708 7270; www.newsfromnowhere.org.uk   ‘We are sensitive to all things to do with women and women having a life,’ says Sara, the newbie member (a mere eight years) of the women’s co-op that runs this radical bookshop. If the place had a matriarch, which it doesn’t, being a socialist organisation, then Mandy would fill the role: she has been here since 1976 and has the flowing robes, patient smile and leftist politics you’d expect.  Their computer also looks to have arrived in the mid-Seventies – it even has a flashing cursor. But it can find the internet and the shop does sell online, although this is a real community hub, which is presumably how it survives on a dilapidated high street that has lost out to a big new shopping centre, and that houses two other bookshops. Mandy is unperturbed. ‘It’s better to be near each other,’ she says, ‘it’s handy for people who like browsing bookshops.’  The place is shabby but loved, with a rack of newsletters, a section devoted to violence against women but also lots of fiction and history, particularly Irish (‘we were a major source of information through the Troubles’). They do stock books by men; they also have a children’s corner with world folk tales.  Mandy points out that Liverpool has a history of radicalism and that the shop’s supporters rally around when they get into trouble, offering credit loans against future purchases; and they do a lot with John Moores University.  While I’m there, a young man asks Mandy for a book which has to be ordered from the US. Hearing that there is a copy in, but it’s promised to someone, he offers to pay extra. I watch fascinated as socialist principle confronts the spectre of ravening capitalism (admittedly, in the shape of a guy who wants to get his chum a present). Mandy shakes her head firmly: one small step for mankind.  8 Poetry Bookshop, Hay-on-Wye   Ice House, Brook Street, 01497 821812; www.poetrybookshop.com   The Princes weren’t going to show me the Georgian ice house beneath their little shop in Hay-on-Wye, but I asked about foreign language poetry and that’s stored downstairs.  The enormous brick-lined cylinder, like a giant well, would have been packed with ice; now, thanks to electricity and refrigerators, it’s redundant. Maybe the sheer weirdness of the legendary book town on the Welsh borders, where even the local café’s menu says, ‘Please note: these dishes are prepared in a nutty environment’, is affecting me, but I know I wouldn’t want quite such a majestic symbol of obsolescence beneath my obscure specialist bookshop.  With his long hair and thin grey sweater, Chris looks like a cliché of a poetry obsessive, although actually he was just looking for something to do when this shop came up for sale. With an older, male customer who is threatening to sleep in the field where book festival events take place (the 80,000 visitors have outgrown even the town’s 30-odd bookshops), a lively three-way discussion on old jazz sleevenotes gets under way, soon shading into the inevitable conversation on the future of bookshops.  Chris acknowledges that being a specialist limits both his purchasing possibilities and his customer base but, he says, ‘people like the idea that a poetry bookshop exists. And if you like poetry books – and I know a lot of people can live without them – then it’s wonderful to be in a room with so many.’ He does find the internet threatening because ‘it makes everybody an expert’ and he thinks the Government should subsidise bookshop rents because they bring culture to the high street, which leads to a three-way row: I don’t feel that’s viable.  During this I discover that the customer is not a customer but a published poet. So he may have been serious about kipping in the field.

 Oh business – how can people?’ wailed Nancy Mitford while attempting to discuss her share of Mayfair bookshop Heywood Hill in 1948; amazingly, it’s still there, even though the hilarious letters between Mitford and Hill make it clear that when it came to business, these people couldn’t, really.  Any bookseller who requires his own slang term (to couch) for ‘to place in a pile and leave until dust settles or emergency strikes’ was probably never going to die rich.  Then again, if you want business acuity in a bookshop, go to the relevant shelf: it has rarely been found behind the counter. The Net Book Agreement, which precluded discounts until the Nineties, and the absence of any real competition before the internet, meant that until recently practically anyone could make a living (but not a fortune) selling books.  George Orwell, writing in 1936, reckoned that since the corporates would never be able to squeeze independent booksellers the way they had the grocer or the milkman, ‘it is a humane trade which is not capable of being vulgarised beyond a certain point’.  He was wrong about big business – these days, some bookshops are decidedly more equal than others – but while 102 (nearly 10 per cent of the total) closed in 2009, according to the Booksellers Association, there are still independents dotted all over the country, usually in villages and market towns where they help reinforce a sense of community. Which is odd when you consider that reading is one of the most solitary pursuits around  Small bookshops, however, are gregarious: when I set out to find those that were doing well and how they were managing to hold back the tide of so-called progress, I encountered roaring fires, free coffee and regulars who were greeted by name and were happy to talk, especially about books.  I was there in search of personalities – the booksellers, of course, but also the shops themselves, which despite their similarities had, like dogs are said to, come to resemble their owners. No small business is having an easy time at the moment, although the internet actually gives at least as much as it takes away: most of the people I spoke to sell online, find books for customers that way and even order through Amazon for people who don’t want to do so themselves.  In fact, it is publishers who are really causing the small shops trouble by undercutting them. Apparently they don’t see how cannibalistic this is: kill the little businesses and they’ll be entirely at Amazon’s mercy.  Still, for the moment, the death of the independent bookshop has been greatly exaggerated, so I have selected these rather as one chooses books in a good shop: by running my finger along the possibilities, stopping when something catches my fancy and pulling out those that look really enticing for closer examination.  And, as with good fiction, I have been rewarded with a range of unforgettable characters, overcoming great obstacles and devoting their considerable powers of invention to overseeing bookshops that have as little in common with a blank-faced chain outlet as a newsletter does with a novel.  1 Mr B’s Reading Emporium, Bath   14-15 John Street, 01225 331155; www.mrbsemporium.com (pictured)  Down a titchy street just off the main drag is a pine-lined shop that feels spacious but isn’t: owner Nic Bottomley simply doesn’t go for the atmospheric clutter germane to most booklovers. (‘Books give off more and nastier dust than any other class of objects yet invented,’ Orwell grumbled, ‘and the top of a book is the place where every bluebottle prefers to die.’) Nic is also young, blonde, nattily dressed and exceptionally good at publicity, all of which is so uncommon in this trade that I wonder if he took the wrong turning en route to a real job.  Actually, he was a derivatives trader who cut and ran, taking over an antiques shop’s spare showroom in 2006. Now he has teatowels with cleverly altered quotations (‘a single man in possession of a fortune should spend it at Mr B’s’), a Victorian bath covered in books and a reading booth where, for £3.50, you get a comfy chair, headphones, coffee, biscuits and a closed door with a Do Not Disturb sign. His staff are beyond helpful: clearly living the dream with him, and this spirit of togetherness shows in the handwritten recommendations, complete with cartoons (‘we’ve Simpsonised ourselves!’) that dot the shelves.  Ed expounds his theory that clever publishers are making books into ever more desirable objects, and shows me one with a cover that pulls off to become a map and another with ye olde ruffled page edges, to prove it, while Nic deals with a regular who wants a ‘history of something?’ for his wife, pinpointing Andrew Marr’s A History of Modern Britain within a minute, and sending the man wafting out the door on a blast of information about a forthcoming Marr event, like Mary Poppins carried off by the west wind.  Naturally, Nic is an expert internet user with a blog, a sophisticated stock-searching system and a mass of online sales, but he doesn’t fear the beast, partly because he has tamed it (Mexican-American Pulitzer finalist Luis Alberto Urrea is taking time out of a family holiday to give a talk at Mr B’s on the back of Nic’s mini-review of his book on Twitter) and partly because he understands what it cannot give. He sells a reading spa package, which gets you lots of books and a goody bag but also, and more importantly, an extensive chat over coffee and cake with him about your likes and dislikes. It is, arguably, what booksellers do anyway, but it’s very popular, as expert help generally is and probably – people being sociable creatures – always will be.  2 Al Saqi Books, London   26 Westbourne Grove, 020 7229 8543; www.alsaqibookshop.com   Murder One, the crime bookshop has gone; Charing Cross Road resembles a denuded bookshelf, with a couple of forgotten paperbacks still littering its length. Indomitable Foyles remains and the antiquarian bookshops of Cecil Court; elsewhere, independents still glow like candlelight amid the glare of generic high street shops. There are even brave new ventures, such as the kiosk-sized Herne Hill Books and To Hell With Publishing’s boutique near King’s Cross.  In the city that has everything, though, it is the specialists who are thriving: if you are a foodie, you want to visit Books for Cooks in Notting Hill; if you have itchy feet, Stanfords is the place to scratch them; should you want your children reading in an atmosphere congenial to adults, there’s Victoria Park Books in Hackney; while Al Saqi, the Middle Eastern bookshop near Paddington, caters to Arabic speakers and Anglophones interested in the area – as well as an international readership trying to get hold of books that are banned in the countries in which they are written.  Al Saqi (which means ‘the one who gives you water’) was started in 1979 by the Lebanese sculptress and humanitarian activist Mai Ghoussoub (‘words don’t kill – humans do’) and her friend André Gaspard. Since Ghoussoub’s death in 2007, the shop has been run by Gaspard’s wife, Salwa; the English and Arabic publishing arms are run separately but are, Salwa says, ‘like a family tree’.  The shop sells online but suffers from internet discounting, although Amazon hasn’t started selling Arabic language books yet, but what helps is that ‘we’re very academic and very open-minded’ – an unusual combination. This shop, even more than most of these ‘tiny first-class kennels for underdogs’ (Hill’s phrase), is a safe haven for persecuted literature.  3 Wenlock Books, Much Wenlock   12 High Street, 01952 727877; www.wenlockbooks.co.uk   Anna Dreda is trying to sell tickets to her forthcoming Poetry Festival (patron: Carol Ann Duffy) to those too Luddite to buy them online, so she doesn’t have time to talk, but she does. Clearing a space upstairs, among the second-hand stock (downstairs is new), she tells me about reading Women’s Studies at Birmingham, bringing up children, doing youth work until this chance came up 18 years ago and she gave up everything ‘except circle dancing’. The shop, on the adorable high street of this pretty market town, reflects her tastes: one shelf of humour but five of women’s studies and some very eclectic CDs. There’s a travel section up front and the inevitable local interest books, and a loyal local clientele, supplemented by tourists. However, Anna no longer sells on the internet: ‘I was spending time stuffing books into bags and I didn’t buy this place to do that.’  Anna, who created her own surname by truncating her mother’s first name when she got divorced, is clearly strong-minded, but charming and informal with it: I follow a trail of bookshelves up a staircase and find myself in her office – there is no door to keep punters out. And the regulars’ loyalty is returned: she likes, she says, to buy her second-hand books from people that she’s known ‘so I can pass on stories to the new owners’.  In this spirit, she shows me a book called Pulled Thread Embroidery, owned by Anne Robertson, a local doctor’s wife who used to sew avidly while doing phone duty for her husband. The couple are now frail and have gone into assisted living. ‘They both spent their lives helping the community,’ Anna says, opening the book. A handsewn sampler falls out. We both exclaim over its prettiness but she firmly replaces it – a gift for the book’s purchaser. Then it’s back to the front desk. The Poetry Festival has deprived me of the coffee and WI cake Anna offers punters; I just hope attendees appreciate my sacrifice.  4 Barter Books, Alnwick   Alnwick Station, Wagon Way Road, 01665 604888; www.barterbooks.co.uk   Stuart Manley was a railway enthusiast running a struggling model train shop in a decommissioned station when his wife, Mary, pointed out that books might sell better. Almost 20 years later, they have most of the huge building and have done it up wonderfully: people lounge around reading before a roaring fire in the old waiting room, while the ticket hall smells most inauthentically of good coffee.  Mary deals with externals, he deals with finance, Stuart says, but the gentle whish of the model railway running above the bookshelves was surely his doing. The place is an extraordinary mixture of the canny and the casual: people turning up with boxes of books to barter (‘our most revolutionary idea was being nice to the customers: we can’t take every book but we can be polite about it’), quotes by Baudelaire and Keats strung between shelves, replica Edwardian lunch boxes full of biscuits for sale, as well as every possible permutation of the Second World War poster Stuart famously found in a box of bartered books. ‘Keep Calm and Carry On’ blares from a red background; the poster was never distributed (the only other known original is in the Imperial War Museum), but when Stuart put it up he was deluged with requests to buy a copy. The proceeds must help the ongoing work on this gargantuan – and listed – building.  Stuart says visiting the bigger Hay shops showed him that his 8,000sq ft was enough, although I don’t believe for a minute he’ll stop there. With the carpets, classical music and first editions ranged in cases along the walls, not to mention the literary figures in the trompe l’oeil mural under the eaves, he and Mary have found a way to marry their twin obsessions for trains and books into a place that’s a haven for geeks, and for those just trying to follow the instructions on the poster.  5 Topping & Company, Ely  9 High Street, 01353 645005; www.toppingbooks.co.uk   There’s a rep from publisher Little, Brown, chatting easily at the cash desk in Robert Topping’s woodlined, book-crammed shop next to Ely Cathedral; many of the bigger stores no longer welcome personal visits, he says, but he has a great relationship with Topping’s.  Like so many of today’s independent booksellers, Topping learnt his trade at Waterstone’s, back before founder Tim Waterstone sold up, when the chain was the most exciting thing to happen to bookselling since the invention of the paperback. But before that, he learnt how not to sell them. ‘I first worked at Foyle’s [in London]. I lasted eight months, which was pretty good – Miss Foyle fired everyone sooner or later.’ But that meant you got lots of responsibility really quickly, because your predecessor had probably been fired shortly before you arrived. There was no external phone line, so ordering a book involved ‘sneaking into the manager’s office and using the phone when no one was looking’.  After that, Waterstone was a revelation. ‘He was a wonderful, inspiring man,’ Topping says wistfully. ‘His shops were crammed with books.’ This is clearly Topping’s highest praise: his own three-floor shop (he has another in Bath) is stuffed with them, albeit in an orderly way. We sit at a table in a window-nook, drinking the coffee that is offered free to customers (except he winces at the word customers: ‘the people who come in here love books. They are friends… supporters… our community’). Why not have a café? ‘I’m too jealous of the space. We’re booksellers, not shop owners, so the coffee is free but if we’re busy it arrives a bit more slowly.’  This being a family concern, the handwritten signs on the elegant wooden bookshelves are by his wife, while his son deals with the internet. Topping is no slouch on the recommendation front, informing me that Rose Tremain’s Trespass will be book of the year, even though such certainty has bitten him on the backside occasionally: when Julian Barnes gave a talk in the shop, he announced to the packed crowd that Arthur & George would win the Booker or he, Robert, would eat his hat; it didn’t.  A few months later, Barnes gave a talk at the other shop, with Topping hoping he would have forgotten his rash support; instead, an enormous cake, ordered by the mischievous author, was wheeled in, and the bookseller – along with everyone else – duly ate it.  6 Wigtown, Dumfries & Galloway  www.wigtownbookfestival.com   If you were to look to the left as you zoomed up the M74 towards Glasgow and the Highlands, and you had Superman vision, you would spot Wigtown, about 85 miles away on a promontory that juts towards Ireland. The broad, gracious main square bears witness to the town’s importance in the 19th century and earlier, but by the Eighties the county seat had moved to Dumfries, the creamery and distillery had closed down and the place bore glum witness to Scotland’s industrial decline.  All of which made it a perfect candidate to win a rather unconventional competition aimed at regeneration through bookshops – which it did, becoming Scotland’s official book town in 1997. Now there are 14 booksellers, lots of painters and decorators driving fancy new cars and a town that is managing, if not quite thriving, through the windy end of a chilly winter. In summer, I’m told, the shops are packed, while September heralds the Wigtown Book Festival, during which marquees go up on bookshop lawns, famous authors take over the biggest bookshop’s drawing room and everyone overdoses on literature and gourmet food.  The rest of the time, bookworms can visit at least six bookshops on the main drag, from Reading Lasses, a bookshop with a female bias (Virago classics, an anthology called I Dream of Madonna and a calendar featuring pert farmers in various stages of undress) and an excellent café with homemade cakes; Byre Books (technically a converted stable, not a byre, and probably only big enough for a Shetland pony at that, but full of interesting tomes on mythology, film, theatre and Scotland); The Bookshop, Wigtown’s (and, according to owner Shaun Bythell, Scotland’s) biggest independent bookshop; The Box of Frogs, a children’s bookshop and gift shop; and The Book End Studio, where Julie Houston juggles a toddler, a cleaning job and her own painting with selling books, art and children’s toys. There is also The Old Bank, which was the customs house at the back and a bank at the front until the directors were jailed in 1878 for ‘uttering false accounts’. This solid, spacious building has a whole roomful of scores, sheet music and songbooks, as well as more general stock and is now run by Helena, age five, with occasional humble contributions from her parents, Joyce and Ian.  Wigtown is such an eccentric spot (‘come into this mad place!’, one owner welcomed me, and she isn’t kidding: within 24 hours someone had offered to sell me a bookshop, and the Wild Goose Chase signs are not a reference to the town’s inaccessibility but to an actual event involving real birds), so ensconced in a mythological bygone era where business fitted around chat and the shop was the bit below the family home, that it did not surprise me at all to find that most of the booksellers don’t do much online. ‘That’s always next year’s project,’ several of them told me – but in Wigtown, I’m not sure next year ever comes.  7 News From Nowhere, Liverpool  96 Bold St, 0151 708 7270; www.newsfromnowhere.org.uk   ‘We are sensitive to all things to do with women and women having a life,’ says Sara, the newbie member (a mere eight years) of the women’s co-op that runs this radical bookshop. If the place had a matriarch, which it doesn’t, being a socialist organisation, then Mandy would fill the role: she has been here since 1976 and has the flowing robes, patient smile and leftist politics you’d expect.  Their computer also looks to have arrived in the mid-Seventies – it even has a flashing cursor. But it can find the internet and the shop does sell online, although this is a real community hub, which is presumably how it survives on a dilapidated high street that has lost out to a big new shopping centre, and that houses two other bookshops. Mandy is unperturbed. ‘It’s better to be near each other,’ she says, ‘it’s handy for people who like browsing bookshops.’  The place is shabby but loved, with a rack of newsletters, a section devoted to violence against women but also lots of fiction and history, particularly Irish (‘we were a major source of information through the Troubles’). They do stock books by men; they also have a children’s corner with world folk tales.  Mandy points out that Liverpool has a history of radicalism and that the shop’s supporters rally around when they get into trouble, offering credit loans against future purchases; and they do a lot with John Moores University.  While I’m there, a young man asks Mandy for a book which has to be ordered from the US. Hearing that there is a copy in, but it’s promised to someone, he offers to pay extra. I watch fascinated as socialist principle confronts the spectre of ravening capitalism (admittedly, in the shape of a guy who wants to get his chum a present). Mandy shakes her head firmly: one small step for mankind.  8 Poetry Bookshop, Hay-on-Wye   Ice House, Brook Street, 01497 821812; www.poetrybookshop.com   The Princes weren’t going to show me the Georgian ice house beneath their little shop in Hay-on-Wye, but I asked about foreign language poetry and that’s stored downstairs.  The enormous brick-lined cylinder, like a giant well, would have been packed with ice; now, thanks to electricity and refrigerators, it’s redundant. Maybe the sheer weirdness of the legendary book town on the Welsh borders, where even the local café’s menu says, ‘Please note: these dishes are prepared in a nutty environment’, is affecting me, but I know I wouldn’t want quite such a majestic symbol of obsolescence beneath my obscure specialist bookshop.  With his long hair and thin grey sweater, Chris looks like a cliché of a poetry obsessive, although actually he was just looking for something to do when this shop came up for sale. With an older, male customer who is threatening to sleep in the field where book festival events take place (the 80,000 visitors have outgrown even the town’s 30-odd bookshops), a lively three-way discussion on old jazz sleevenotes gets under way, soon shading into the inevitable conversation on the future of bookshops.  Chris acknowledges that being a specialist limits both his purchasing possibilities and his customer base but, he says, ‘people like the idea that a poetry bookshop exists. And if you like poetry books – and I know a lot of people can live without them – then it’s wonderful to be in a room with so many.’ He does find the internet threatening because ‘it makes everybody an expert’ and he thinks the Government should subsidise bookshop rents because they bring culture to the high street, which leads to a three-way row: I don’t feel that’s viable.  During this I discover that the customer is not a customer but a published poet. So he may have been serious about kipping in the field.

Which is odd when you consider that reading is one of the most solitary pursuits around  Small bookshops, however, are gregarious: when I set out to find those that were doing well and how they were managing to hold back the tide of so-called progress, I encountered roaring fires, free coffee and regulars who were greeted by name and were happy to talk, especially about books.  I was there in search of personalities – the booksellers, of course, but also the shops themselves, which despite their similarities had, like dogs are said to, come to resemble their owners. No small business is having an easy time at the moment, although the internet actually gives at least as much as it takes away: most of the people I spoke to sell online, find books for customers that way and even order through Amazon for people who don’t want to do so themselves.  In fact, it is publishers who are really causing the small shops trouble by undercutting them. Apparently they don’t see how cannibalistic this is: kill the little businesses and they’ll be entirely at Amazon’s mercy.  Still, for the moment, the death of the independent bookshop has been greatly exaggerated, so I have selected these rather as one chooses books in a good shop: by running my finger along the possibilities, stopping when something catches my fancy and pulling out those that look really enticing for closer examination.  And, as with good fiction, I have been rewarded with a range of unforgettable characters, overcoming great obstacles and devoting their considerable powers of invention to overseeing bookshops that have as little in common with a blank-faced chain outlet as a newsletter does with a novel.  1 Mr B’s Reading Emporium, Bath   14-15 John Street, 01225 331155; www.mrbsemporium.com (pictured)  Down a titchy street just off the main drag is a pine-lined shop that feels spacious but isn’t: owner Nic Bottomley simply doesn’t go for the atmospheric clutter germane to most booklovers. (‘Books give off more and nastier dust than any other class of objects yet invented,’ Orwell grumbled, ‘and the top of a book is the place where every bluebottle prefers to die.’) Nic is also young, blonde, nattily dressed and exceptionally good at publicity, all of which is so uncommon in this trade that I wonder if he took the wrong turning en route to a real job.  Actually, he was a derivatives trader who cut and ran, taking over an antiques shop’s spare showroom in 2006. Now he has teatowels with cleverly altered quotations (‘a single man in possession of a fortune should spend it at Mr B’s’), a Victorian bath covered in books and a reading booth where, for £3.50, you get a comfy chair, headphones, coffee, biscuits and a closed door with a Do Not Disturb sign. His staff are beyond helpful: clearly living the dream with him, and this spirit of togetherness shows in the handwritten recommendations, complete with cartoons (‘we’ve Simpsonised ourselves!’) that dot the shelves.  Ed expounds his theory that clever publishers are making books into ever more desirable objects, and shows me one with a cover that pulls off to become a map and another with ye olde ruffled page edges, to prove it, while Nic deals with a regular who wants a ‘history of something?’ for his wife, pinpointing Andrew Marr’s A History of Modern Britain within a minute, and sending the man wafting out the door on a blast of information about a forthcoming Marr event, like Mary Poppins carried off by the west wind.  Naturally, Nic is an expert internet user with a blog, a sophisticated stock-searching system and a mass of online sales, but he doesn’t fear the beast, partly because he has tamed it (Mexican-American Pulitzer finalist Luis Alberto Urrea is taking time out of a family holiday to give a talk at Mr B’s on the back of Nic’s mini-review of his book on Twitter) and partly because he understands what it cannot give. He sells a reading spa package, which gets you lots of books and a goody bag but also, and more importantly, an extensive chat over coffee and cake with him about your likes and dislikes. It is, arguably, what booksellers do anyway, but it’s very popular, as expert help generally is and probably – people being sociable creatures – always will be.  2 Al Saqi Books, London   26 Westbourne Grove, 020 7229 8543; www.alsaqibookshop.com   Murder One, the crime bookshop has gone; Charing Cross Road resembles a denuded bookshelf, with a couple of forgotten paperbacks still littering its length. Indomitable Foyles remains and the antiquarian bookshops of Cecil Court; elsewhere, independents still glow like candlelight amid the glare of generic high street shops. There are even brave new ventures, such as the kiosk-sized Herne Hill Books and To Hell With Publishing’s boutique near King’s Cross.  In the city that has everything, though, it is the specialists who are thriving: if you are a foodie, you want to visit Books for Cooks in Notting Hill; if you have itchy feet, Stanfords is the place to scratch them; should you want your children reading in an atmosphere congenial to adults, there’s Victoria Park Books in Hackney; while Al Saqi, the Middle Eastern bookshop near Paddington, caters to Arabic speakers and Anglophones interested in the area – as well as an international readership trying to get hold of books that are banned in the countries in which they are written.  Al Saqi (which means ‘the one who gives you water’) was started in 1979 by the Lebanese sculptress and humanitarian activist Mai Ghoussoub (‘words don’t kill – humans do’) and her friend André Gaspard. Since Ghoussoub’s death in 2007, the shop has been run by Gaspard’s wife, Salwa; the English and Arabic publishing arms are run separately but are, Salwa says, ‘like a family tree’.  The shop sells online but suffers from internet discounting, although Amazon hasn’t started selling Arabic language books yet, but what helps is that ‘we’re very academic and very open-minded’ – an unusual combination. This shop, even more than most of these ‘tiny first-class kennels for underdogs’ (Hill’s phrase), is a safe haven for persecuted literature.  3 Wenlock Books, Much Wenlock   12 High Street, 01952 727877; www.wenlockbooks.co.uk   Anna Dreda is trying to sell tickets to her forthcoming Poetry Festival (patron: Carol Ann Duffy) to those too Luddite to buy them online, so she doesn’t have time to talk, but she does. Clearing a space upstairs, among the second-hand stock (downstairs is new), she tells me about reading Women’s Studies at Birmingham, bringing up children, doing youth work until this chance came up 18 years ago and she gave up everything ‘except circle dancing’. The shop, on the adorable high street of this pretty market town, reflects her tastes: one shelf of humour but five of women’s studies and some very eclectic CDs. There’s a travel section up front and the inevitable local interest books, and a loyal local clientele, supplemented by tourists. However, Anna no longer sells on the internet: ‘I was spending time stuffing books into bags and I didn’t buy this place to do that.’  Anna, who created her own surname by truncating her mother’s first name when she got divorced, is clearly strong-minded, but charming and informal with it: I follow a trail of bookshelves up a staircase and find myself in her office – there is no door to keep punters out. And the regulars’ loyalty is returned: she likes, she says, to buy her second-hand books from people that she’s known ‘so I can pass on stories to the new owners’.  In this spirit, she shows me a book called Pulled Thread Embroidery, owned by Anne Robertson, a local doctor’s wife who used to sew avidly while doing phone duty for her husband. The couple are now frail and have gone into assisted living. ‘They both spent their lives helping the community,’ Anna says, opening the book. A handsewn sampler falls out. We both exclaim over its prettiness but she firmly replaces it – a gift for the book’s purchaser. Then it’s back to the front desk. The Poetry Festival has deprived me of the coffee and WI cake Anna offers punters; I just hope attendees appreciate my sacrifice.  4 Barter Books, Alnwick   Alnwick Station, Wagon Way Road, 01665 604888; www.barterbooks.co.uk   Stuart Manley was a railway enthusiast running a struggling model train shop in a decommissioned station when his wife, Mary, pointed out that books might sell better. Almost 20 years later, they have most of the huge building and have done it up wonderfully: people lounge around reading before a roaring fire in the old waiting room, while the ticket hall smells most inauthentically of good coffee.  Mary deals with externals, he deals with finance, Stuart says, but the gentle whish of the model railway running above the bookshelves was surely his doing. The place is an extraordinary mixture of the canny and the casual: people turning up with boxes of books to barter (‘our most revolutionary idea was being nice to the customers: we can’t take every book but we can be polite about it’), quotes by Baudelaire and Keats strung between shelves, replica Edwardian lunch boxes full of biscuits for sale, as well as every possible permutation of the Second World War poster Stuart famously found in a box of bartered books. ‘Keep Calm and Carry On’ blares from a red background; the poster was never distributed (the only other known original is in the Imperial War Museum), but when Stuart put it up he was deluged with requests to buy a copy. The proceeds must help the ongoing work on this gargantuan – and listed – building.  Stuart says visiting the bigger Hay shops showed him that his 8,000sq ft was enough, although I don’t believe for a minute he’ll stop there. With the carpets, classical music and first editions ranged in cases along the walls, not to mention the literary figures in the trompe l’oeil mural under the eaves, he and Mary have found a way to marry their twin obsessions for trains and books into a place that’s a haven for geeks, and for those just trying to follow the instructions on the poster.  5 Topping & Company, Ely  9 High Street, 01353 645005; www.toppingbooks.co.uk   There’s a rep from publisher Little, Brown, chatting easily at the cash desk in Robert Topping’s woodlined, book-crammed shop next to Ely Cathedral; many of the bigger stores no longer welcome personal visits, he says, but he has a great relationship with Topping’s.  Like so many of today’s independent booksellers, Topping learnt his trade at Waterstone’s, back before founder Tim Waterstone sold up, when the chain was the most exciting thing to happen to bookselling since the invention of the paperback. But before that, he learnt how not to sell them. ‘I first worked at Foyle’s [in London]. I lasted eight months, which was pretty good – Miss Foyle fired everyone sooner or later.’ But that meant you got lots of responsibility really quickly, because your predecessor had probably been fired shortly before you arrived. There was no external phone line, so ordering a book involved ‘sneaking into the manager’s office and using the phone when no one was looking’.  After that, Waterstone was a revelation. ‘He was a wonderful, inspiring man,’ Topping says wistfully. ‘His shops were crammed with books.’ This is clearly Topping’s highest praise: his own three-floor shop (he has another in Bath) is stuffed with them, albeit in an orderly way. We sit at a table in a window-nook, drinking the coffee that is offered free to customers (except he winces at the word customers: ‘the people who come in here love books. They are friends… supporters… our community’). Why not have a café? ‘I’m too jealous of the space. We’re booksellers, not shop owners, so the coffee is free but if we’re busy it arrives a bit more slowly.’  This being a family concern, the handwritten signs on the elegant wooden bookshelves are by his wife, while his son deals with the internet. Topping is no slouch on the recommendation front, informing me that Rose Tremain’s Trespass will be book of the year, even though such certainty has bitten him on the backside occasionally: when Julian Barnes gave a talk in the shop, he announced to the packed crowd that Arthur & George would win the Booker or he, Robert, would eat his hat; it didn’t.  A few months later, Barnes gave a talk at the other shop, with Topping hoping he would have forgotten his rash support; instead, an enormous cake, ordered by the mischievous author, was wheeled in, and the bookseller – along with everyone else – duly ate it.  6 Wigtown, Dumfries & Galloway  www.wigtownbookfestival.com   If you were to look to the left as you zoomed up the M74 towards Glasgow and the Highlands, and you had Superman vision, you would spot Wigtown, about 85 miles away on a promontory that juts towards Ireland. The broad, gracious main square bears witness to the town’s importance in the 19th century and earlier, but by the Eighties the county seat had moved to Dumfries, the creamery and distillery had closed down and the place bore glum witness to Scotland’s industrial decline.  All of which made it a perfect candidate to win a rather unconventional competition aimed at regeneration through bookshops – which it did, becoming Scotland’s official book town in 1997. Now there are 14 booksellers, lots of painters and decorators driving fancy new cars and a town that is managing, if not quite thriving, through the windy end of a chilly winter. In summer, I’m told, the shops are packed, while September heralds the Wigtown Book Festival, during which marquees go up on bookshop lawns, famous authors take over the biggest bookshop’s drawing room and everyone overdoses on literature and gourmet food.  The rest of the time, bookworms can visit at least six bookshops on the main drag, from Reading Lasses, a bookshop with a female bias (Virago classics, an anthology called I Dream of Madonna and a calendar featuring pert farmers in various stages of undress) and an excellent café with homemade cakes; Byre Books (technically a converted stable, not a byre, and probably only big enough for a Shetland pony at that, but full of interesting tomes on mythology, film, theatre and Scotland); The Bookshop, Wigtown’s (and, according to owner Shaun Bythell, Scotland’s) biggest independent bookshop; The Box of Frogs, a children’s bookshop and gift shop; and The Book End Studio, where Julie Houston juggles a toddler, a cleaning job and her own painting with selling books, art and children’s toys. There is also The Old Bank, which was the customs house at the back and a bank at the front until the directors were jailed in 1878 for ‘uttering false accounts’. This solid, spacious building has a whole roomful of scores, sheet music and songbooks, as well as more general stock and is now run by Helena, age five, with occasional humble contributions from her parents, Joyce and Ian.  Wigtown is such an eccentric spot (‘come into this mad place!’, one owner welcomed me, and she isn’t kidding: within 24 hours someone had offered to sell me a bookshop, and the Wild Goose Chase signs are not a reference to the town’s inaccessibility but to an actual event involving real birds), so ensconced in a mythological bygone era where business fitted around chat and the shop was the bit below the family home, that it did not surprise me at all to find that most of the booksellers don’t do much online. ‘That’s always next year’s project,’ several of them told me – but in Wigtown, I’m not sure next year ever comes.  7 News From Nowhere, Liverpool  96 Bold St, 0151 708 7270; www.newsfromnowhere.org.uk   ‘We are sensitive to all things to do with women and women having a life,’ says Sara, the newbie member (a mere eight years) of the women’s co-op that runs this radical bookshop. If the place had a matriarch, which it doesn’t, being a socialist organisation, then Mandy would fill the role: she has been here since 1976 and has the flowing robes, patient smile and leftist politics you’d expect.  Their computer also looks to have arrived in the mid-Seventies – it even has a flashing cursor. But it can find the internet and the shop does sell online, although this is a real community hub, which is presumably how it survives on a dilapidated high street that has lost out to a big new shopping centre, and that houses two other bookshops. Mandy is unperturbed. ‘It’s better to be near each other,’ she says, ‘it’s handy for people who like browsing bookshops.’  The place is shabby but loved, with a rack of newsletters, a section devoted to violence against women but also lots of fiction and history, particularly Irish (‘we were a major source of information through the Troubles’). They do stock books by men; they also have a children’s corner with world folk tales.  Mandy points out that Liverpool has a history of radicalism and that the shop’s supporters rally around when they get into trouble, offering credit loans against future purchases; and they do a lot with John Moores University.  While I’m there, a young man asks Mandy for a book which has to be ordered from the US. Hearing that there is a copy in, but it’s promised to someone, he offers to pay extra. I watch fascinated as socialist principle confronts the spectre of ravening capitalism (admittedly, in the shape of a guy who wants to get his chum a present). Mandy shakes her head firmly: one small step for mankind.  8 Poetry Bookshop, Hay-on-Wye   Ice House, Brook Street, 01497 821812; www.poetrybookshop.com   The Princes weren’t going to show me the Georgian ice house beneath their little shop in Hay-on-Wye, but I asked about foreign language poetry and that’s stored downstairs.  The enormous brick-lined cylinder, like a giant well, would have been packed with ice; now, thanks to electricity and refrigerators, it’s redundant. Maybe the sheer weirdness of the legendary book town on the Welsh borders, where even the local café’s menu says, ‘Please note: these dishes are prepared in a nutty environment’, is affecting me, but I know I wouldn’t want quite such a majestic symbol of obsolescence beneath my obscure specialist bookshop.  With his long hair and thin grey sweater, Chris looks like a cliché of a poetry obsessive, although actually he was just looking for something to do when this shop came up for sale. With an older, male customer who is threatening to sleep in the field where book festival events take place (the 80,000 visitors have outgrown even the town’s 30-odd bookshops), a lively three-way discussion on old jazz sleevenotes gets under way, soon shading into the inevitable conversation on the future of bookshops.  Chris acknowledges that being a specialist limits both his purchasing possibilities and his customer base but, he says, ‘people like the idea that a poetry bookshop exists. And if you like poetry books – and I know a lot of people can live without them – then it’s wonderful to be in a room with so many.’ He does find the internet threatening because ‘it makes everybody an expert’ and he thinks the Government should subsidise bookshop rents because they bring culture to the high street, which leads to a three-way row: I don’t feel that’s viable.  During this I discover that the customer is not a customer but a published poet. So he may have been serious about kipping in the field. 
 Oh business – how can people?’ wailed Nancy Mitford while attempting to discuss her share of Mayfair bookshop Heywood Hill in 1948; amazingly, it’s still there, even though the hilarious letters between Mitford and Hill make it clear that when it came to business, these people couldn’t, really.  Any bookseller who requires his own slang term (to couch) for ‘to place in a pile and leave until dust settles or emergency strikes’ was probably never going to die rich.  Then again, if you want business acuity in a bookshop, go to the relevant shelf: it has rarely been found behind the counter. The Net Book Agreement, which precluded discounts until the Nineties, and the absence of any real competition before the internet, meant that until recently practically anyone could make a living (but not a fortune) selling books.  George Orwell, writing in 1936, reckoned that since the corporates would never be able to squeeze independent booksellers the way they had the grocer or the milkman, ‘it is a humane trade which is not capable of being vulgarised beyond a certain point’.

In summer, I’m told, the shops are packed, while September heralds the Wigtown Book Festival, during which marquees go up on bookshop lawns, famous authors take over the biggest bookshop’s drawing room and everyone overdoses on literature and gourmet food.  The rest of the time, bookworms can visit at least six bookshops on the main drag, from Reading Lasses, a bookshop with a female bias (Virago classics, an anthology called I Dream of Madonna and a calendar featuring pert farmers in various stages of undress) and an excellent café with homemade cakes; Byre Books (technically a converted stable, not a byre, and probably only big enough for a Shetland pony at that, but full of interesting tomes on mythology, film, theatre and Scotland); The Bookshop, Wigtown’s (and, according to owner Shaun Bythell, Scotland’s) biggest independent bookshop; The Box of Frogs, a children’s bookshop and gift shop; and The Book End Studio, where Julie Houston juggles a toddler, a cleaning job and her own painting with selling books, art and children’s toys. There is also The Old Bank, which was the customs house at the back and a bank at the front until the directors were jailed in 1878 for ‘uttering false accounts’. This solid, spacious building has a whole roomful of scores, sheet music and songbooks, as well as more general stock and is now run by Helena, age five, with occasional humble contributions from her parents, Joyce and Ian.  Wigtown is such an eccentric spot (‘come into this mad place!’, one owner welcomed me, and she isn’t kidding: within 24 hours someone had offered to sell me a bookshop, and the Wild Goose Chase signs are not a reference to the town’s inaccessibility but to an actual event involving real birds), so ensconced in a mythological bygone era where business fitted around chat and the shop was the bit below the family home, that it did not surprise me at all to find that most of the booksellers don’t do much online. ‘That’s always next year’s project,’ several of them told me – but in Wigtown, I’m not sure next year ever comes.  7 News From Nowhere, Liverpool  96 Bold St, 0151 708 7270; www.newsfromnowhere.org.uk   ‘We are sensitive to all things to do with women and women having a life,’ says Sara, the newbie member (a mere eight years) of the women’s co-op that runs this radical bookshop. If the place had a matriarch, which it doesn’t, being a socialist organisation, then Mandy would fill the role: she has been here since 1976 and has the flowing robes, patient smile and leftist politics you’d expect.  Their computer also looks to have arrived in the mid-Seventies – it even has a flashing cursor. But it can find the internet and the shop does sell online, although this is a real community hub, which is presumably how it survives on a dilapidated high street that has lost out to a big new shopping centre, and that houses two other bookshops. Mandy is unperturbed. ‘It’s better to be near each other,’ she says, ‘it’s handy for people who like browsing bookshops.’  The place is shabby but loved, with a rack of newsletters, a section devoted to violence against women but also lots of fiction and history, particularly Irish (‘we were a major source of information through the Troubles’). They do stock books by men; they also have a children’s corner with world folk tales.  Mandy points out that Liverpool has a history of radicalism and that the shop’s supporters rally around when they get into trouble, offering credit loans against future purchases; and they do a lot with John Moores University.  While I’m there, a young man asks Mandy for a book which has to be ordered from the US. Hearing that there is a copy in, but it’s promised to someone, he offers to pay extra. I watch fascinated as socialist principle confronts the spectre of ravening capitalism (admittedly, in the shape of a guy who wants to get his chum a present). Mandy shakes her head firmly: one small step for mankind.  8 Poetry Bookshop, Hay-on-Wye   Ice House, Brook Street, 01497 821812; www.poetrybookshop.com   The Princes weren’t going to show me the Georgian ice house beneath their little shop in Hay-on-Wye, but I asked about foreign language poetry and that’s stored downstairs.  The enormous brick-lined cylinder, like a giant well, would have been packed with ice; now, thanks to electricity and refrigerators, it’s redundant. Maybe the sheer weirdness of the legendary book town on the Welsh borders, where even the local café’s menu says, ‘Please note: these dishes are prepared in a nutty environment’, is affecting me, but I know I wouldn’t want quite such a majestic symbol of obsolescence beneath my obscure specialist bookshop.  With his long hair and thin grey sweater, Chris looks like a cliché of a poetry obsessive, although actually he was just looking for something to do when this shop came up for sale. With an older, male customer who is threatening to sleep in the field where book festival events take place (the 80,000 visitors have outgrown even the town’s 30-odd bookshops), a lively three-way discussion on old jazz sleevenotes gets under way, soon shading into the inevitable conversation on the future of bookshops.  Chris acknowledges that being a specialist limits both his purchasing possibilities and his customer base but, he says, ‘people like the idea that a poetry bookshop exists. And if you like poetry books – and I know a lot of people can live without them – then it’s wonderful to be in a room with so many.’ He does find the internet threatening because ‘it makes everybody an expert’ and he thinks the Government should subsidise bookshop rents because they bring culture to the high street, which leads to a three-way row: I don’t feel that’s viable.  During this I discover that the customer is not a customer but a published poet. So he may have been serious about kipping in the field.
