"Lo/Hi," the first single from The Black Keys' upcoming ninth studio album, surges with 2.3 million U.S. streams and 8,000 downloads sold, according to Nielsen Music. It also breaks into the top five of the Rock Airplay chart (No. 4; 7.2 million impressions) and the top 10 on the Adult Alternative Songs (No. 6) and Alternative Songs (No. 9) airplay tallies.The track debuts at No. 4 on Rock Digital Song Sales, the twosome's best rank, surpassing the No. 7 debut and peak of "Fever" in April 2014.The buzz surrounding "Lo/Hi" is due in large part to it being the first new music from Dan Auerbach and Patrick Carney together as The Black Keys since 2014's Turn Blue, which opened at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. The act has since been mostly on hiatus, with each member recording projects either solo or with others, as well as producing others' records.
