					I wouldn't expect full system specs to be revealed for a little while. This is what Nintendo said in its PR: "Todays video incorporated short glimpses of representative gameplay to demonstrate the liberating nature of the Nintendo Switch home gaming system. Full game demonstrations, the list of launch window titles, as well as launch date, price, product configuration and related specifics, will be shown and announced prior to the March launch."

					Looks interesting. The launch software is going to be important, as is the release schedule over the first year -- Nintendo needs to have regular releases of strong titles, unlike the long drought for important Wii U titles. The specs will be interesting, but what's important are the games and how fun they are, not how many polygons are on screen. The other major issue is going to be the price. Sony and Microsoft give you quite a lot for $299 these days. How will the Switch price -- and more importantly, its value -- compare?

					I think this move will eliminate the need for Nintendo to develop software for multiple consoles. That should help with the drought in their first party lineup and third party support is very encouraging. I'm very happy with  what I've seen so far.
3ds probably has 3 more years of support at most now and the Wii U will be dead in the water after 2017

					What was the Vita accused of again? Something about home experiences making no sense on the go?  Don't wait for March, take one of the Intel Z8300  tablets with Windows, install Steam and two Bluetooth controllers, go re-enact the scenes from the trailer. The device is neat, but its success will be defined by the games and more importantly all the other apps it may or may not support (e.g. Netflix, messaging, browser, Plex, etc.) to reach the age demographic depicted in this trailer. Even then, does Gamevice plus Nintendo games equal success? I concede, 10-20 million people from the Nintendo core audience will have a terrific time with this latest toy, but it will take a lot more to reach the rest.
Also, eSports...

					The system will live or die on the content as we know - and with Pokemon on the roster, and hopefully that front facing AR camera [yet to be seen], it could do well in the short term - but those dedicated legs do not seem to be there - no matter the hype machine (eSport Nintendo... give me a break!)

					Content is key, but marketing will be even more important. It is a great prospect, but how will the mass market see it? A console with only mobile performance? A Gameboy with pieces to lose or break? Or a flexible device that meets all your gaming needs?
It will die if either content or marketing are not top-class. One out of four scenarios (1. Has content and marketing. 2. Has content, lacks marketing. 3. Lacks content, has marketing. 4. Lacks content and marketing) leads to success. I hope success is the outcome. I would love to develop for it, and play on it.

					@Adam
sure the Z8300 GPU is an abomination, but you get an idea whether the scenarios the trailer suggests work or not. The Z8300 does not need to run Skyrim for that. Just run Brawlhalla from Steam on a small screen with two controllers while on the go. Ask yourself, is this something that could work better, when all the IPs and brands are in place? When the cheap tablet is replaced by a Switch and the knock off Smash Brothers game is replaced by the real IP.
The nVidia Shield K1 is by no means a bad device, but is a Nintendo branded refresh of that thing really the big thing Nintendo is expected to land?

					I think Nintendo just announced to the world that they're happy to reside as the second console in the house, first for kids / family.  Third party support for this is going to be as woeful as its been for the Wii-U, it'll really make no sense to attempt to port top AAA titles from PS4 over to this.  Stoked for the Nintendo content, if it takes up the 3DS market and the Wii-U market it will be a nice money maker for Nintendo.

If you're asking whether or not the Nintendo Switch is more enticing than devices with a chip that can't compete with last year's phones  (Intel Atom), barely able to run games, or a technically strong tablet with a poor ecosystem for specialised titles (Shield) that never stood a chance in the gaming market then my answer is yes.
I think being a Nintendo machine, better hardware & controls and probably a lot better thought out than the Vita ever was, gives it a huge advantage even if that's no guarantee for success. I can see where the comparison comes in, but every one of the predecessors score low marks for execution.

					This Tablet needs to be comparable to an Apple or Android Tablet in functionality. If it can pull off all of those tricks as well as provide that same Nintendo magic with even a few steps up in tech then the audience will eat it up. If it is only a games console and mediocre multimedia features then I just dont see many people carrying this thing around. It will sell. But if they can bake in all of the above features then the prospect becomes quite promising.

					Happened to be using a Shield today, an old one but while the feel of it is lovely it was very underpowered, can see the NX solving that problem in the form factor/price.  Not sure where in the house this one goes it is even less distinct than a 3DS.  We let the kids use them because they are small/not online and fold up.  The NX has none of this and is not really a home console either.

					The lack of an AR component would not have been as big of an issue until the PokemonGo phenomena.
As Nintendo had to buy an ex-Google developer with the skills to AR, because of Nintendo's R&D's skill set of difficult to embrace change played a major component. So expecting that same mindset to embrace VR was nieve.
Waiting to see who Nintendo will acquire to get this skill set - or if they feel the fence is comfortable?
But yes, seems Nintendo just reserved the second place spot in the console wars (might be a good place to be if the market is changing!)

		2 years ago@Jordan Lund: The problem there is, it HAS to be confirmed or else both Nintendo and Bethsoft will hear from some very annoyed internet raaaaagers. You can't show a big game like that in a huge new system reveal and NOT have it come out. That's the worst sort of bait & switch to pull on a new console's fans/potential buyers, especially as it's not a game that can be called vaporware. Hell, I had six Skyrim conversations today alone, four of which were from people who don't play western RPGs or have (gasp!) never heard of an Elder Scrolls game.
My take on that reveal and Bethsoft's not confirming it is Nintendo wants the new Zelda to sell huge (if it's part of a pack-in launch bundle, they'll note 1:1 sales for it at some point) and be the go-to "big" game for a period of time before is slides into evergreen status. Somewhere between those two periods is where Skyrim will pop up as game to buy for those Nintendo-only gamers yet to play it. That said, I have played it, but would buy it again just to see how the heck it turned out.

					Does anyone need this device? No. Will enough people want it?  I think I'd be one of those that would want it, as I don't currently have a console, and I like the modularity. They will have to reach beyond a closed community of developers though, and create a democratised marketplace, or it'll end up like the Vita in the smartphone and tablet world.

					Target demographic seems to be edging older with the Switch - video shows young adults and the form factor is less toy like, more elegant. This could result in a higher launch price if also the chipset is a more advanced Tegra family member such as the X1 rather than the K1. The trick with these videos is to work out where the smoke and mirrors are.

					, KWP Limited2 years agoPokemon Go is not an AR game, it's a Geo-positional game.
@Richard Browne: That statement is a strident viewpoint that sadly is not accurate on the whole. The PG concept combines a geo-tagging element to an AR game. The combat (grinding) element as strong, if not stronger than the searching element - though the implementation leaves a lot to be desired as the developers are finding out concerning the games longevity. To dismissively claim it is not one thing seems to miss the point and may illustrate a miss understanding of the package.
Regarding the latest breaking Nintendo developments over Switch - we see the share market voting with their feet regarding the development presented by Nintendo. The company has positioned this new platform in such a way that it is a 'make or break' strategy with no middle ground. They have presented a system that will greatly impact their current game deck business and will confuse their smart phone game offering.
More importantly, this launch has illustrated an observation by many analysis towards Nintendo's executive pool - are they capable of understanding the market? The less than stellar marketing promotion of this new system topped off with a highly questionable marketing video that has caused some derision, would suggest a power vacuum in the company regarding forward strategy. Though Switch is an interesting approach, its implementation (as seen with WiiU) could be hampered by an 'old guard' executive team.

The same could be said about the Wii U, and I was really excited about what the additional touchscreen could offer, but developers just didn't care -- or more likely publishers didn't care.  Creativity is risky, and publishers aren't interested. I want to believe things will be different this time around, but I can't imagine why anything would change other than maybe the Switch gets a bunch of ports of older games from other consoles?

Skyrim Remastered is set to launch on October 28 for Xbox One, PS4 and PC; perhaps the Switch will receive a version of the Remastered game at launch?Update 3:Reuters reports that Nintendo's shares fell by 6% early this morning following yesterday's reveal of its new Switch console. The stock fell as low as ¥25,300 at 0101 GMT, which is the lowest point since September 7th. Technically this is only a 3% decline compared to earlier in the week as Pocket Gamer reports Nintendo's shares rose by 3.7% to ¥26,950 in the hours before the reveal, later tumbling by 6.55%. A minor drop, but perhaps one that shows scepticism about Nintendo Switch's chances of success.

					I wouldn't expect full system specs to be revealed for a little while. This is what Nintendo said in its PR: "Todays video incorporated short glimpses of representative gameplay to demonstrate the liberating nature of the Nintendo Switch home gaming system. Full game demonstrations, the list of launch window titles, as well as launch date, price, product configuration and related specifics, will be shown and announced prior to the March launch."

					Looks interesting. The launch software is going to be important, as is the release schedule over the first year -- Nintendo needs to have regular releases of strong titles, unlike the long drought for important Wii U titles. The specs will be interesting, but what's important are the games and how fun they are, not how many polygons are on screen. The other major issue is going to be the price. Sony and Microsoft give you quite a lot for $299 these days. How will the Switch price -- and more importantly, its value -- compare?

					I think this move will eliminate the need for Nintendo to develop software for multiple consoles. That should help with the drought in their first party lineup and third party support is very encouraging. I'm very happy with  what I've seen so far.
3ds probably has 3 more years of support at most now and the Wii U will be dead in the water after 2017

					What was the Vita accused of again? Something about home experiences making no sense on the go?  Don't wait for March, take one of the Intel Z8300  tablets with Windows, install Steam and two Bluetooth controllers, go re-enact the scenes from the trailer. The device is neat, but its success will be defined by the games and more importantly all the other apps it may or may not support (e.g. Netflix, messaging, browser, Plex, etc.) to reach the age demographic depicted in this trailer. Even then, does Gamevice plus Nintendo games equal success? I concede, 10-20 million people from the Nintendo core audience will have a terrific time with this latest toy, but it will take a lot more to reach the rest.
Also, eSports...

					The system will live or die on the content as we know - and with Pokemon on the roster, and hopefully that front facing AR camera [yet to be seen], it could do well in the short term - but those dedicated legs do not seem to be there - no matter the hype machine (eSport Nintendo... give me a break!)

					Content is key, but marketing will be even more important. It is a great prospect, but how will the mass market see it? A console with only mobile performance? A Gameboy with pieces to lose or break? Or a flexible device that meets all your gaming needs?
It will die if either content or marketing are not top-class. One out of four scenarios (1. Has content and marketing. 2. Has content, lacks marketing. 3. Lacks content, has marketing. 4. Lacks content and marketing) leads to success. I hope success is the outcome. I would love to develop for it, and play on it.

					@Adam
sure the Z8300 GPU is an abomination, but you get an idea whether the scenarios the trailer suggests work or not. The Z8300 does not need to run Skyrim for that. Just run Brawlhalla from Steam on a small screen with two controllers while on the go. Ask yourself, is this something that could work better, when all the IPs and brands are in place? When the cheap tablet is replaced by a Switch and the knock off Smash Brothers game is replaced by the real IP.
The nVidia Shield K1 is by no means a bad device, but is a Nintendo branded refresh of that thing really the big thing Nintendo is expected to land?

					I think Nintendo just announced to the world that they're happy to reside as the second console in the house, first for kids / family.  Third party support for this is going to be as woeful as its been for the Wii-U, it'll really make no sense to attempt to port top AAA titles from PS4 over to this.  Stoked for the Nintendo content, if it takes up the 3DS market and the Wii-U market it will be a nice money maker for Nintendo.

If you're asking whether or not the Nintendo Switch is more enticing than devices with a chip that can't compete with last year's phones  (Intel Atom), barely able to run games, or a technically strong tablet with a poor ecosystem for specialised titles (Shield) that never stood a chance in the gaming market then my answer is yes.
I think being a Nintendo machine, better hardware & controls and probably a lot better thought out than the Vita ever was, gives it a huge advantage even if that's no guarantee for success. I can see where the comparison comes in, but every one of the predecessors score low marks for execution.

					This Tablet needs to be comparable to an Apple or Android Tablet in functionality. If it can pull off all of those tricks as well as provide that same Nintendo magic with even a few steps up in tech then the audience will eat it up. If it is only a games console and mediocre multimedia features then I just dont see many people carrying this thing around. It will sell. But if they can bake in all of the above features then the prospect becomes quite promising.

					Happened to be using a Shield today, an old one but while the feel of it is lovely it was very underpowered, can see the NX solving that problem in the form factor/price.  Not sure where in the house this one goes it is even less distinct than a 3DS.  We let the kids use them because they are small/not online and fold up.  The NX has none of this and is not really a home console either.

					The lack of an AR component would not have been as big of an issue until the PokemonGo phenomena.
As Nintendo had to buy an ex-Google developer with the skills to AR, because of Nintendo's R&D's skill set of difficult to embrace change played a major component. So expecting that same mindset to embrace VR was nieve.
Waiting to see who Nintendo will acquire to get this skill set - or if they feel the fence is comfortable?
But yes, seems Nintendo just reserved the second place spot in the console wars (might be a good place to be if the market is changing!)

		2 years ago@Jordan Lund: The problem there is, it HAS to be confirmed or else both Nintendo and Bethsoft will hear from some very annoyed internet raaaaagers. You can't show a big game like that in a huge new system reveal and NOT have it come out. That's the worst sort of bait & switch to pull on a new console's fans/potential buyers, especially as it's not a game that can be called vaporware. Hell, I had six Skyrim conversations today alone, four of which were from people who don't play western RPGs or have (gasp!) never heard of an Elder Scrolls game.
My take on that reveal and Bethsoft's not confirming it is Nintendo wants the new Zelda to sell huge (if it's part of a pack-in launch bundle, they'll note 1:1 sales for it at some point) and be the go-to "big" game for a period of time before is slides into evergreen status. Somewhere between those two periods is where Skyrim will pop up as game to buy for those Nintendo-only gamers yet to play it. That said, I have played it, but would buy it again just to see how the heck it turned out.

					Target demographic seems to be edging older with the Switch - video shows young adults and the form factor is less toy like, more elegant. This could result in a higher launch price if also the chipset is a more advanced Tegra family member such as the X1 rather than the K1. The trick with these videos is to work out where the smoke and mirrors are.

					, KWP Limited2 years agoPokemon Go is not an AR game, it's a Geo-positional game.
@Richard Browne: That statement is a strident viewpoint that sadly is not accurate on the whole. The PG concept combines a geo-tagging element to an AR game. The combat (grinding) element as strong, if not stronger than the searching element - though the implementation leaves a lot to be desired as the developers are finding out concerning the games longevity. To dismissively claim it is not one thing seems to miss the point and may illustrate a miss understanding of the package.
Regarding the latest breaking Nintendo developments over Switch - we see the share market voting with their feet regarding the development presented by Nintendo. The company has positioned this new platform in such a way that it is a 'make or break' strategy with no middle ground. They have presented a system that will greatly impact their current game deck business and will confuse their smart phone game offering.
More importantly, this launch has illustrated an observation by many analysis towards Nintendo's executive pool - are they capable of understanding the market? The less than stellar marketing promotion of this new system topped off with a highly questionable marketing video that has caused some derision, would suggest a power vacuum in the company regarding forward strategy. Though Switch is an interesting approach, its implementation (as seen with WiiU) could be hampered by an 'old guard' executive team.

The same could be said about the Wii U, and I was really excited about what the additional touchscreen could offer, but developers just didn't care -- or more likely publishers didn't care.  Creativity is risky, and publishers aren't interested. I want to believe things will be different this time around, but I can't imagine why anything would change other than maybe the Switch gets a bunch of ports of older games from other consoles?

					Target demographic seems to be edging older with the Switch - video shows young adults and the form factor is less toy like, more elegant. This could result in a higher launch price if also the chipset is a more advanced Tegra family member such as the X1 rather than the K1. The trick with these videos is to work out where the smoke and mirrors are.

@Richard Browne: That statement is a strident viewpoint that sadly is not accurate on the whole. The PG concept combines a geo-tagging element to an AR game. The combat (grinding) element as strong, if not stronger than the searching element - though the implementation leaves a lot to be desired as the developers are finding out concerning the games longevity. To dismissively claim it is not one thing seems to miss the point and may illustrate a miss understanding of the package.
Regarding the latest breaking Nintendo developments over Switch - we see the share market voting with their feet regarding the development presented by Nintendo. The company has positioned this new platform in such a way that it is a 'make or break' strategy with no middle ground. They have presented a system that will greatly impact their current game deck business and will confuse their smart phone game offering.
More importantly, this launch has illustrated an observation by many analysis towards Nintendo's executive pool - are they capable of understanding the market? The less than stellar marketing promotion of this new system topped off with a highly questionable marketing video that has caused some derision, would suggest a power vacuum in the company regarding forward strategy. Though Switch is an interesting approach, its implementation (as seen with WiiU) could be hampered by an 'old guard' executive team.

This is what Nintendo said in its PR: "Todays video incorporated short glimpses of representative gameplay to demonstrate the liberating nature of the Nintendo Switch home gaming system. Full game demonstrations, the list of launch window titles, as well as launch date, price, product configuration and related specifics, will be shown and announced prior to the March launch."

					Looks interesting. The launch software is going to be important, as is the release schedule over the first year -- Nintendo needs to have regular releases of strong titles, unlike the long drought for important Wii U titles. The specs will be interesting, but what's important are the games and how fun they are, not how many polygons are on screen. The other major issue is going to be the price. Sony and Microsoft give you quite a lot for $299 these days. How will the Switch price -- and more importantly, its value -- compare?

					I think this move will eliminate the need for Nintendo to develop software for multiple consoles. That should help with the drought in their first party lineup and third party support is very encouraging. I'm very happy with  what I've seen so far.
3ds probably has 3 more years of support at most now and the Wii U will be dead in the water after 2017

					What was the Vita accused of again? Something about home experiences making no sense on the go?  Don't wait for March, take one of the Intel Z8300  tablets with Windows, install Steam and two Bluetooth controllers, go re-enact the scenes from the trailer. The device is neat, but its success will be defined by the games and more importantly all the other apps it may or may not support (e.g. Netflix, messaging, browser, Plex, etc.) to reach the age demographic depicted in this trailer. Even then, does Gamevice plus Nintendo games equal success? I concede, 10-20 million people from the Nintendo core audience will have a terrific time with this latest toy, but it will take a lot more to reach the rest.

					Content is key, but marketing will be even more important. It is a great prospect, but how will the mass market see it? A console with only mobile performance? A Gameboy with pieces to lose or break? Or a flexible device that meets all your gaming needs?
It will die if either content or marketing are not top-class. One out of four scenarios (1. Has content and marketing. 2. Has content, lacks marketing. 3. Lacks content, has marketing. 4. Lacks content and marketing) leads to success. I hope success is the outcome. I would love to develop for it, and play on it.

					@Adam
sure the Z8300 GPU is an abomination, but you get an idea whether the scenarios the trailer suggests work or not. The Z8300 does not need to run Skyrim for that. Just run Brawlhalla from Steam on a small screen with two controllers while on the go. Ask yourself, is this something that could work better, when all the IPs and brands are in place? When the cheap tablet is replaced by a Switch and the knock off Smash Brothers game is replaced by the real IP.
The nVidia Shield K1 is by no means a bad device, but is a Nintendo branded refresh of that thing really the big thing Nintendo is expected to land?

					I think Nintendo just announced to the world that they're happy to reside as the second console in the house, first for kids / family.  Third party support for this is going to be as woeful as its been for the Wii-U, it'll really make no sense to attempt to port top AAA titles from PS4 over to this.  Stoked for the Nintendo content, if it takes up the 3DS market and the Wii-U market it will be a nice money maker for Nintendo.

If you're asking whether or not the Nintendo Switch is more enticing than devices with a chip that can't compete with last year's phones  (Intel Atom), barely able to run games, or a technically strong tablet with a poor ecosystem for specialised titles (Shield) that never stood a chance in the gaming market then my answer is yes.
I think being a Nintendo machine, better hardware & controls and probably a lot better thought out than the Vita ever was, gives it a huge advantage even if that's no guarantee for success. I can see where the comparison comes in, but every one of the predecessors score low marks for execution.

					This Tablet needs to be comparable to an Apple or Android Tablet in functionality. If it can pull off all of those tricks as well as provide that same Nintendo magic with even a few steps up in tech then the audience will eat it up. If it is only a games console and mediocre multimedia features then I just dont see many people carrying this thing around. It will sell. But if they can bake in all of the above features then the prospect becomes quite promising.

					Happened to be using a Shield today, an old one but while the feel of it is lovely it was very underpowered, can see the NX solving that problem in the form factor/price.  Not sure where in the house this one goes it is even less distinct than a 3DS.  We let the kids use them because they are small/not online and fold up.  The NX has none of this and is not really a home console either.

					The lack of an AR component would not have been as big of an issue until the PokemonGo phenomena.
As Nintendo had to buy an ex-Google developer with the skills to AR, because of Nintendo's R&D's skill set of difficult to embrace change played a major component. So expecting that same mindset to embrace VR was nieve.
Waiting to see who Nintendo will acquire to get this skill set - or if they feel the fence is comfortable?
But yes, seems Nintendo just reserved the second place spot in the console wars (might be a good place to be if the market is changing!)

		2 years ago@Jordan Lund: The problem there is, it HAS to be confirmed or else both Nintendo and Bethsoft will hear from some very annoyed internet raaaaagers. You can't show a big game like that in a huge new system reveal and NOT have it come out. That's the worst sort of bait & switch to pull on a new console's fans/potential buyers, especially as it's not a game that can be called vaporware. Hell, I had six Skyrim conversations today alone, four of which were from people who don't play western RPGs or have (gasp!) never heard of an Elder Scrolls game.
My take on that reveal and Bethsoft's not confirming it is Nintendo wants the new Zelda to sell huge (if it's part of a pack-in launch bundle, they'll note 1:1 sales for it at some point) and be the go-to "big" game for a period of time before is slides into evergreen status. Somewhere between those two periods is where Skyrim will pop up as game to buy for those Nintendo-only gamers yet to play it. That said, I have played it, but would buy it again just to see how the heck it turned out.

					Looks interesting. The launch software is going to be important, as is the release schedule over the first year -- Nintendo needs to have regular releases of strong titles, unlike the long drought for important Wii U titles. The specs will be interesting, but what's important are the games and how fun they are, not how many polygons are on screen. The other major issue is going to be the price. Sony and Microsoft give you quite a lot for $299 these days. How will the Switch price -- and more importantly, its value -- compare?

					I think this move will eliminate the need for Nintendo to develop software for multiple consoles. That should help with the drought in their first party lineup and third party support is very encouraging. I'm very happy with  what I've seen so far.
3ds probably has 3 more years of support at most now and the Wii U will be dead in the water after 2017

It will die if either content or marketing are not top-class. One out of four scenarios (1. Has content and marketing. 2. Has content, lacks marketing. 3. Lacks content, has marketing. 4. Lacks content and marketing) leads to success. I hope success is the outcome. I would love to develop for it, and play on it.

sure the Z8300 GPU is an abomination, but you get an idea whether the scenarios the trailer suggests work or not. The Z8300 does not need to run Skyrim for that. Just run Brawlhalla from Steam on a small screen with two controllers while on the go. Ask yourself, is this something that could work better, when all the IPs and brands are in place? When the cheap tablet is replaced by a Switch and the knock off Smash Brothers game is replaced by the real IP.
The nVidia Shield K1 is by no means a bad device, but is a Nintendo branded refresh of that thing really the big thing Nintendo is expected to land?

Third party support for this is going to be as woeful as its been for the Wii-U, it'll really make no sense to attempt to port top AAA titles from PS4 over to this.

If you're asking whether or not the Nintendo Switch is more enticing than devices with a chip that can't compete with last year's phones  (Intel Atom), barely able to run games, or a technically strong tablet with a poor ecosystem for specialised titles (Shield) that never stood a chance in the gaming market then my answer is yes.
I think being a Nintendo machine, better hardware & controls and probably a lot better thought out than the Vita ever was, gives it a huge advantage even if that's no guarantee for success. I can see where the comparison comes in, but every one of the predecessors score low marks for execution.

As Nintendo had to buy an ex-Google developer with the skills to AR, because of Nintendo's R&D's skill set of difficult to embrace change played a major component. So expecting that same mindset to embrace VR was nieve.
Waiting to see who Nintendo will acquire to get this skill set - or if they feel the fence is comfortable?

		2 years ago@Jordan Lund: The problem there is, it HAS to be confirmed or else both Nintendo and Bethsoft will hear from some very annoyed internet raaaaagers. You can't show a big game like that in a huge new system reveal and NOT have it come out. That's the worst sort of bait & switch to pull on a new console's fans/potential buyers, especially as it's not a game that can be called vaporware. Hell, I had six Skyrim conversations today alone, four of which were from people who don't play western RPGs or have (gasp!) never heard of an Elder Scrolls game.
My take on that reveal and Bethsoft's not confirming it is Nintendo wants the new Zelda to sell huge (if it's part of a pack-in launch bundle, they'll note 1:1 sales for it at some point) and be the go-to "big" game for a period of time before is slides into evergreen status. Somewhere between those two periods is where Skyrim will pop up as game to buy for those Nintendo-only gamers yet to play it. That said, I have played it, but would buy it again just to see how the heck it turned out.

They will have to reach beyond a closed community of developers though, and create a democratised marketplace, or it'll end up like the Vita in the smartphone and tablet world.

					Target demographic seems to be edging older with the Switch - video shows young adults and the form factor is less toy like, more elegant. This could result in a higher launch price if also the chipset is a more advanced Tegra family member such as the X1 rather than the K1. The trick with these videos is to work out where the smoke and mirrors are.

					, KWP Limited2 years agoPokemon Go is not an AR game, it's a Geo-positional game.
@Richard Browne: That statement is a strident viewpoint that sadly is not accurate on the whole. The PG concept combines a geo-tagging element to an AR game. The combat (grinding) element as strong, if not stronger than the searching element - though the implementation leaves a lot to be desired as the developers are finding out concerning the games longevity. To dismissively claim it is not one thing seems to miss the point and may illustrate a miss understanding of the package.
Regarding the latest breaking Nintendo developments over Switch - we see the share market voting with their feet regarding the development presented by Nintendo. The company has positioned this new platform in such a way that it is a 'make or break' strategy with no middle ground. They have presented a system that will greatly impact their current game deck business and will confuse their smart phone game offering.
More importantly, this launch has illustrated an observation by many analysis towards Nintendo's executive pool - are they capable of understanding the market? The less than stellar marketing promotion of this new system topped off with a highly questionable marketing video that has caused some derision, would suggest a power vacuum in the company regarding forward strategy. Though Switch is an interesting approach, its implementation (as seen with WiiU) could be hampered by an 'old guard' executive team.

The same could be said about the Wii U, and I was really excited about what the additional touchscreen could offer, but developers just didn't care -- or more likely publishers didn't care.  Creativity is risky, and publishers aren't interested. I want to believe things will be different this time around, but I can't imagine why anything would change other than maybe the Switch gets a bunch of ports of older games from other consoles?

That said, I have played it, but would buy it again just to see how the heck it turned out.

		2 years ago@Jordan Lund: The problem there is, it HAS to be confirmed or else both Nintendo and Bethsoft will hear from some very annoyed internet raaaaagers. You can't show a big game like that in a huge new system reveal and NOT have it come out. That's the worst sort of bait & switch to pull on a new console's fans/potential buyers, especially as it's not a game that can be called vaporware. Hell, I had six Skyrim conversations today alone, four of which were from people who don't play western RPGs or have (gasp!) never heard of an Elder Scrolls game.

					This system has potential but I'm not sure if there is enough there to make me want to SWITCH from my current Xbox One. What....too soon?

		2 years agoWhile Bethesda's much beloved Skyrim was clearly shown during Nintendo's Switch reveal video, the publisher told us today that it's not officially confirming the game just yet.
Then why put it in the video?????

					Does anyone need this device? No. Will enough people want it?  I think I'd be one of those that would want it, as I don't currently have a console, and I like the modularity. They will have to reach beyond a closed community of developers though, and create a democratised marketplace, or it'll end up like the Vita in the smartphone and tablet world.

					Head of External Projects, Digital Extremes2 years ago@kevin williams:Pokemon Go is not an AR game, it's a Geo-positional game.  The AR element is utterly irrelevant except to marketing via social media ; and we know how Nintendo feels about that sort of integration into what is fundamentally a kids/family product.

					Head of External Projects, Digital Extremes2 years ago@Andrew Watson:Pretty sure Skyrim is coming ; this machine should be capable of a port from XBox 360 or PS3.  What I doubt we'll see is Red Dead 2 or anything designed for pushing current gen platforms.

					Target demographic seems to be edging older with the Switch - video shows young adults and the form factor is less toy like, more elegant. This could result in a higher launch price if also the chipset is a more advanced Tegra family member such as the X1 rather than the K1. The trick with these videos is to work out where the smoke and mirrors are.

					, KWP Limited2 years agoPokemon Go is not an AR game, it's a Geo-positional game.
@Richard Browne: That statement is a strident viewpoint that sadly is not accurate on the whole. The PG concept combines a geo-tagging element to an AR game. The combat (grinding) element as strong, if not stronger than the searching element - though the implementation leaves a lot to be desired as the developers are finding out concerning the games longevity. To dismissively claim it is not one thing seems to miss the point and may illustrate a miss understanding of the package.
Regarding the latest breaking Nintendo developments over Switch - we see the share market voting with their feet regarding the development presented by Nintendo. The company has positioned this new platform in such a way that it is a 'make or break' strategy with no middle ground. They have presented a system that will greatly impact their current game deck business and will confuse their smart phone game offering.
More importantly, this launch has illustrated an observation by many analysis towards Nintendo's executive pool - are they capable of understanding the market? The less than stellar marketing promotion of this new system topped off with a highly questionable marketing video that has caused some derision, would suggest a power vacuum in the company regarding forward strategy. Though Switch is an interesting approach, its implementation (as seen with WiiU) could be hampered by an 'old guard' executive team.

		2 years ago"It gives game developers new abilities to bring their creative visions to life by opening up the concept of gaming without boundaries."
The same could be said about the Wii U, and I was really excited about what the additional touchscreen could offer, but developers just didn't care -- or more likely publishers didn't care.  Creativity is risky, and publishers aren't interested. I want to believe things will be different this time around, but I can't imagine why anything would change other than maybe the Switch gets a bunch of ports of older games from other consoles?
