John Prescott and Kama Sutra abandoned in hotel rooms

Chart-topper: The memoirs of the former deputy PM John Prescott fail to excite Travelodge guests. Photograph: Dan Chung




The thwarted aspirations of the man who discarded both The Kama Sutra for Dummies and How To Be a Gentleman in Seven Days in a Southampton hotel room can only be imagined, but sex manuals were just the tip of the reject pile in budget hotels this summer. 
Travelodge's annual list of the books most often abandoned in its hotels is topped by John Prescott's Prezza: My Story, in which among other things we are told about how Prescott was excluded from invitations to Chequers. Prescott beat comedian Russell Brand to take the dubious accolade of most discarded author, while Cherie Blair – who presumably had something to do with Prescott's lack of social invites – comes in third with her own autobiography Speaking For Myself.
The ubiquitous former Mirror editor Piers Morgan, meanwhile, is in the top 10 most discarded books for the second year in a row: last year his Don't You Know Who I Am? was pipped to the top by Alastair Campbell's The Blair Years; this year Morgan comes in fourth.
The rest of the list shows a propensity towards lighter reading, with Katie Price's two novels scoring highly, along with Cathy Kelly. The entry of You and Your Money by Alvin Hall into the top ten shows that the reading habits of the UK are turning towards penny pinching in these difficult times – although clearly not enough to actually hold onto the book.
Travelodge has also applied a regional analysis to the abandoned titles, discovering that Cardiff and London hotel guests are most likely to discard money saving books – reflecting despair at the high cost of city life, perhaps – while Cornwall holiday-makers have left behind the most spiritual titles. 
Paul Anstey, Travelodge operations director, said that overall the most discarded genres were autobiographies, chick lit and thriller books. "This summer we have found a number of money saving books, revealing just how much the credit crunch is taking hold," he added.
A further "key finding" from the survey of 336 hotel managers reveals that Travelodge's Southend-on-Sea branch was the lucky recipient of a copy of The Best 50 Love Making Positions for the Over 50s. Its Peterborough branch, meanwhile, saw its customers abandon 10 copies of the Kama Sutra.
Overall 7,000 books were left behind in Travelodge hotels throughout the year. Travelodge either returns the books to customers, or donates them to local charity shops.
The top ten most discarded books in hotel rooms this summer: 1. Prezza: Pulling No Punches by John Prescott2. My Booky Wook by Russell Brand3. Speaking For Myself by Cherie Blair4. Don't You Know Who I Am by Piers Morgan?5. Angel Uncovered and Crystal by Katie Price6. You and Your Money by Alvin Hall7. Lessons in Heartbreak by Cathy Kelly8. Blind Faith by Ben Elton9.
