Katy Perry brought her fast-rising hit "Birthday" to the Billboard Music Awards in stunning fashion, performing the smashing dance single for the first time on television during the 2014 ceremony on Sunday night (May 18).Katy Wins Top Female Artist: Performing remotely from the Newcastle Metro Radio Arena during the awards ceremony, which happened live from the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, a green-haired Perry blew out her candles with an unbelievable take on the song. After inviting a shocked fan who was celebrating her birthday to join her onstage, Perry flew away from the spinning cake and backup dancers on the arena's platform, riding a zipline over the audience that made it seem like she was floating away on a collection of balloons. Perry has been trotting out "Birthday" on her just-started Prismatic world tour, but at the Billboard Music Awards, the throwback jam proved to be even more enthralling."Birthday" is the latest single from Perry's third studio album "PRISM," which debuted at No. 1 upon its release last October. The single moves up four spots to No. 25 on this week's Hot 100 chart, where to previous "PRISM" singles -- "Roar" and "Dark Horse" -- already notched No. 1 peaks.Katy Perry: The 'PRISM' Cover StoryPerry was just one of the show-stoppers performing at the 2014 Billboard Music Awards, which had already presented performances by 5 Seconds of Summer, Shakira, Florida Georgia Line, Ariana Grande, Iggy Azalea and more by the time the KatyCats got to watch their idol. Perry is a finalist for Top Artist at the Billboard Music Awards, along with Miley Cyrus, Imagine Dragons, Bruno Mars and Justin Timberlake.Want to watch Perry make it like your birthday everyday -- in various wacky costumes?
