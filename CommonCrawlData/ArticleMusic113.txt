Nicki Minaj's new single, which will be released on Wednesday (May 21), now has a title: "Pills N Potions."The rapper unveiled the title on the red carpet of the 2014 Billboard Music Awards on Sunday night (May 18), where she introduced Lorde's performance of "Tennis Court." Minaj also described the sound of "Pills N Potions," which precedes her third album "The Pinkprint," to Billboard's Keith Caulfield."It sounds like urgency," says Minaj. "It sounds like betrayal. It sounds like running. It sounds like fainting. It sounds like love. It sounds like -- *gasp!*"When asked about the release of "The Pinkprint," which follows 2012's hits-packed sophomore album "Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded," Minaj did confirm that it would be out later this year, but could not get any more specific. "The album will be out before 2015," she says.Earlier this month, Minaj dropped a promotional track, "Yasss Bish!!," that featured Soulja Boy. Her single "Lookin Ass" was also featured on the Young Money compilation "Young Money: Rise of an Empire."Billboard Music Awards Red Carpet Video The online extension of Billboard Magazine, billboard.biz is the essential online destination for the music business.Learn More© 2019 Billboard.
