If you've been reading them you might have noticed they're all really, really different, but there was enough of a common thread that we used a somewhat scientific process, spearheaded by Mack, to pull them all together for an all-CB top 10. By ranking each pick on a numerical scaleThis list started as an unfilled Word document saying “Best Movies” on January 1st , and it ended with over one hundred films that have been obsessively tweaked. There’s no ulterior motives and no efforts to impress behind the choices I’ve made. These are just the ones I liked a little bit more than the rest. As both a film critic and reporter, I have to sit through a lot of terrible movies. This year I spent hours of my life watching movies like New Year's Eve, Spy Kids: All The Time in the World, Abduction and Waiting For Forever. But it's the good movies that make it all worth it, and this year there were some truly brilliant films in release. But among those great titles, what were my favorites? Well...We might have bitten off more than we can chew with this year-end list. In trying to single out the top 10 lines of dialogue from 2011, we found ourselves trimming away choice soundbites from such outstanding scripts as Tom McCarthy’s Win Win; Mike Mills’ Beginners; the hilarious and infinitely quotable The TripA decade spent working as a professional film critic has brought me here, to my tenth annual obligatory best of the year list. What you're getting here is a list of the 2011 movies which I think were the best. This list has the soul of a hero.There were plenty of movies from this year that I absolutely loved and others that I absolutely hated, but there’s a very special category that exists between both of those ends: the ones that left me utterly disappointed. While I always enter a movie theater hoping to love the hell out of whatever I’m watching, the truth is that there are some films that I spend a lot of time thinking about and anticipating, only to be left frustrated at the end.Yesterday, we gave you our list of Top 10 Female Characters of 2011. Today, it’s all about the men and looking back over the course of the year, it’s not difficult to appreciate the excellent male characters that had us coming back for more, week after week. Our list includes a meth cook, a crafty Lannister, a software genius, and a dad/former-POW/potential terrorist. There's a difference between a death used to move the story forward and a death that really matters, something you remember long after the movie is finished, something you might even tear up about years later. We think we've picked out ten of those belowAs the year draws to a close, we’re rounding off the last of our “Best of 2011” lists. In looking over our list of the best female TV characters from this year, it’s evident that TV delivered some excellent women to the screen. Some were as fierce as warriors, while others made us laugh. One birthed a baby while another birthed dragons. One attempted to protect the country from terrorism, while another sipped champagne and glared a lot. These are our picks for the best female characters on TV in 2011.Within these blockbusters, we found memorable action set pieces and bone-crunching fistfights that deserved recognition. (And in the case of Brad Bird’s Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol, we enjoyed a steady stream of both!) These are the ten most memorable fights and action set pieces from the year The rules of this top 10 list are simple. I chose from among the movies released theatrically in 2011 that I saw, which means no festival releases that didn't come to theaters, no older movies I caught up with this year, and, obviously, nothing I didn't see. There are some films that I missed that may have made this listMuch like 2010, this year was packed with not only amazing soundtracks, but also movies that knew how to use songs to perfect effect. From the synth sounds in Drive to the insanely happy tunes in The Muppets, this year in music moments made audiences feel unending joy and devastating sadness, but it all made for great times at the cinema.2011 was a good year for television, which made selecting the top ten shows of the year a tricky task. Not all of our favorites will win awards for their greatness, but whether it was because they made us laugh, made us think, kept us on the edge of our seats or simply entertained us, these are the shows we loved the most in 2011.Everyone knows that movies aren't just "great" or "awful," and every year there are movies that are perfectly good, maybe even great, that get overlooked entirely. Whether it's because they were box office flops, unfairly critically maligned or somehow otherwise ignored, there are always movies that seem in danger of getting forgotten entirely in the rush to move on to the next yearDeath is a part of life, and it’s also a big part of television. 2011 was no exception there. We took a look back at some of the more memorable deaths from TV this year. Whether they died by their own hand, their own sword, an oncoming train or at the hands of someone they thought they could trust, how each character died and how their death impacted the story factored into our choices as much as who the character was. I’m not saying these 10 performances are Oscar-worthy--- and because they're so small, they likely won't be considered for any of the big prizes no matter what. Yet these memorable turns by the following supporting players always enhanced their finished films, and often were the topic of conversation as we exited the theaters. Below are my choices for the Ten Best Tiny Supporting Roles for 2011There are plenty of actors who make bad movies while still being fairly likable-- Nicolas Cage and now Liam Neeson are making careers of this-- but only a select few who pop up out of the mess and do something great. We're kicking off our end of the year coverage2011 has been a great year for television, with too many memorable moments worth mentioning. We managed to chip away at the long list of our favorite bits from this year’s TV, bringing it down to the ten best of the best. From a very dark timeline, to a big reveal and a couple of major deaths, TV had a lot to offer us this year.
