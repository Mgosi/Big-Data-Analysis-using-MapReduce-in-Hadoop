We'll all finally find out the answer this week as Quantic Dream's latest cinematic gaming experience, Beyond: Two Souls, finally arrives on the PlayStation 3. And just in case you've got a lot of free time on your hands this week, Beyond is bringing a lot of friends along for the ride in this week's batch of new releases.A week before launch and Quantic Dream's new supernatural adventure thriller, Beyond: Two Souls, starring Ellen Page and Willem Dafoe has been leaked to torrents... all 25 gigabytes of it.Oftentimes it's stated that the average AAA game middles out to around $25 million when it comes to development costs. The lower end of the AAA development costs start at $10 million and the ceiling, so far, has been set by Rockstar at $265 million for Grand Theft Auto V. Well, for one of the movie-oriented AAA titles due out this fall, Beyond: Two Souls, the development costs were quite moderate, making out at the $27 million mark.There are some segments in the new trailer for Beyond: Two Souls featuring the lead protagonist played by Ellen Page encountering some world-ending scenarios. It appears the game may be a heck of a lot bigger than just some pesky ghost following around a young woman.That makes two videos now that get a “Must Buy” descriptor. The first was Watch Dogs and the second is now Beyond: Two Souls. So what makes the game must-buy? Well, we finally get to see some real gameplay and some contextual commentary to let us know how diverse the game really is.Quantic Dream and Sony have released a new trailer for Beyond: Two Souls, showing the behind-the-scenes production and design properties while also showcasing a few more gameplay elements, including a look at some of the wilder sides of Ellen Page's character.Quantic Dream's Beyond: Two Souls was a special entry at this year's Tribeca Film Festival and they sliced off 35 minutes of gameplay to showcase, which you can experience right here, right now, for free. We constantly hear about games that don't break even, barely break even or didn't sell fast enough to turn a profit for the publisher, developer or sometimes the distributor. That was not the case with Quantic Dream's Heavy Rain. The creative niche title cost just less than half of a $100 million to produce and it made back more than double its own production costs.Sony unveiled the official box art for the PS3 exclusive Beyond: Two Souls today. The cover really spells out Quantic Dream's goal to deliver a film-like experience to gamers.Willem Dafoe has been announced as an official cast member for upcoming PlayStation 3 exclusive, Beyond: Two Souls, joining fellow silver screen star Ellen Page in Quantic Dream’s latest offering. Along with the announcement that Dafoe will be in the game, the developers have also given the title an official release date of Oct. 8.If you thought little 'ole Ellen Page wasn't big or bad enough to take down a group of heavily armed police enforcers, you thought wrong. While she lacks the muscles of Stallone and Schwarzenegger, she makes up for it with the help of an ethereal friend played by none other than you, the player.It might be awhile before we get a look at the actual gameplay for Quantic Dream's Beyond: Two Souls. In the mean time, though, we've got a batch of concept art to gaze over for hints at the game's plot.
