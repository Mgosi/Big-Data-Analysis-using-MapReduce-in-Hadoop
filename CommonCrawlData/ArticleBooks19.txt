By Willing DavidsonApril 14, 2009Last week’s contest was a farce, a real disgrace. We asked you to identify four books from details of their covers and … you did. All of you did. There may not have been a single wrong answer among the many dozens we received. Our man Joseph Rebella had the twinklefingers and won the 2009 desk diary, but there were many hot pursuers.So, this week, we’ve decided not to insult your intelligence. Instead, we’re going to insult your taste. Below are details from the covers of four novels that you probably like a little less now than when you first read them. What are they? E-mail us with your answers: the author of the first fully correct response will win a genuine, game-used New Yorker softball cap.(If any of this confuses you, check out our official rules.)Dive into the world of literature with The New Yorker’s weekly fiction newsletter.By Ben TaubBy Mike SpiesBy Susan B.
