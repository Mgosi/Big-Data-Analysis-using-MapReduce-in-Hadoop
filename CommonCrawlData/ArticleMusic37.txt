Hipgnosis Songs has scooped up another arsenal of hits with its acquisition of three songwriters' catalogs, a repertoire that includes rights to Usher's "Yeah," Mariah Carey's "We Belong Together" and Beyoncé's “Check On It."Those writers are Johntá Austin, Sean Garrett and Rico Love, whose combined catalogs comprise more than 1,000 songs. The announcement is just the latest in a string of acquisitions for the music investment IP company, which was set up by former Beyoncé and Guns N' Roses manager Merck Mercuriadis. Austin is a Grammy-winning American singer-songwriter, arranger, producer, vocalist and rapper with credits on Carey's "We Belong Together," as well as Janet Jackson's "Call On Me" featuring Nelly and Mary J Blige's "Be Without You." Garrett, a producer and singer-songwriter, has credits on "Check On It" and has also co-written hits including Ciara's "Goodies" and Britney Spears' "Toy Soldier." And rapper-singer-producer Love's own writing catalog includes credits on Bey's "Sweet Dreams" and Usher's "Throwback," among others.

“I’m very happy to be welcoming Johntá, Sean and Rico into the Hipgnosis family," said Mercuriadis in a statement. "They have each individually written standout songs that define the culture. From Mary J Blige to Usher to Beyoncé, these songs have played a critical role in the evolution of R&B and pop music as we know it today.”Terms were not disclosed for the deal, which gives Hipgnosis a 100 percent interest in all three catalogs, including ASCAP income from Austin and Garrett and SESAC income from Love. For the company's deal with Garrett, Hipgnosis also receives income from BMI.

In late January, Hipgnosis picked up the catalog of Itaal Shur, best known for co-writing the Santana and Rob Thomas smash hit "Smooth." Earlier that same month, Hipgnosis scored the rights to 182 songs by multiple Grammy-winner Giorgio Tuinfort, including songs recorded by Gwen Stefani, Nicki Minaj, Martin Garrix, Rihanna, Avicii, Usher, Will.i.am, Akon and Lionel Richie. Previously, Hipgnosis also acquired stakes in the catalogs of Christopher "Tricky" Stewart, The-Dream and frequent Justin Bieber collaborator Jason Boyd (a.k.a. Poo Bear). The online extension of Billboard Magazine, billboard.biz is the essential online destination for the music business.Learn More© 2019 Billboard. All Rights Reserved.
