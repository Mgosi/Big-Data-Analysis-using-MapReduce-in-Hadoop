As strong storms barreled through a Greensboro neighborhood on Sunday night, a young man on Phillips Avenue helped his sister and nephew stay safe despite being caught up in a video game."I was sitting at home and I was playing Fortnite, and all of sudden, I hear a bunch of noise," Anton Williams told WXII 12's Mallory Lane. "I look out the window and I started seeing the roof come off the houses in front of me."Next door, strong winds blew a family's home away from its foundation."I sit back down because I only have a couple people left in my game, and I was going to try to finish the game, but then it started getting worse and I started to see the power lines come down, so I told my sister and my nephew to come to the bathroom."While seeking shelter in the bathroom, Williams was still focused on his game."Honestly, I was thinking about the game, but I was hoping everybody was OK around me," Williams said.After the storm let up, Williams said he went outside to check on his neighbors -- who were alright.

					As strong storms barreled through a Greensboro neighborhood on Sunday night, a young man on Phillips Avenue helped his sister and nephew stay safe despite being caught up in a video game."I was sitting at home and I was playing Fortnite, and all of sudden, I hear a bunch of noise," Anton Williams told WXII 12's Mallory Lane. "I look out the window and I started seeing the roof come off the houses in front of me."Next door, strong winds blew a family's home away from its foundation."I sit back down because I only have a couple people left in my game, and I was going to try to finish the game, but then it started getting worse and I started to see the power lines come down, so I told my sister and my nephew to come to the bathroom."While seeking shelter in the bathroom, Williams was still focused on his game."Honestly, I was thinking about the game, but I was hoping everybody was OK around me," Williams said.After the storm let up, Williams said he went outside to check on his neighbors -- who were alright.

					As strong storms barreled through a Greensboro neighborhood on Sunday night, a young man on Phillips Avenue helped his sister and nephew stay safe despite being caught up in a video game."I was sitting at home and I was playing Fortnite, and all of sudden, I hear a bunch of noise," Anton Williams told WXII 12's Mallory Lane. "I look out the window and I started seeing the roof come off the houses in front of me."Next door, strong winds blew a family's home away from its foundation."I sit back down because I only have a couple people left in my game, and I was going to try to finish the game, but then it started getting worse and I started to see the power lines come down, so I told my sister and my nephew to come to the bathroom."While seeking shelter in the bathroom, Williams was still focused on his game."Honestly, I was thinking about the game, but I was hoping everybody was OK around me," Williams said.After the storm let up, Williams said he went outside to check on his neighbors -- who were alright.
