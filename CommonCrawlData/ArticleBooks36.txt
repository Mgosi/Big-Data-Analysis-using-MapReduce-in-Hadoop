							By Richard Burton11:14AM BST 17 Sep 2012 2 June 1965  Rose [at] 10 o’clock but weather dull. Had a good row with Burt [Elizabeth Taylor] and accused her, among other things, of lousy taste. She accused me among other things of snobbery. I said the only thing we had in common was Yahtsee. I forgot some other things.  20 March 1966  We had lunch with Vittorio De Sica and his wife and two children (boys). One boy played the guitar – what a horrible instrument, worse than a mouth-accordion, or a paper-and-comb. But De Sica really looked on his son with admiration. He had the face of a demented and somewhat stupefied fish. And so the day wore on inevitably to another regret in the lost and in the future to be recalled days. What shall we do now. B----- it then. Let’s row.  1 April 1966

Richard Burton Diaries: 'I behaved with disgrace'
 What a day! I went in at about 11.30 to see the test of the new costume [for Franco Zeffirelli’s Taming of the Shrew]. It was alright – at least it was better than the other. At lunch I was so exasperated that I left the table snarling, “You’ll excuse me, I’m in a bad mood.” Shumdit [ET] said with her usual immense tact, “Really, Richard?” I snarled again something witty like “Shut your mouth” and went tramping furiously over our few acres with E’en So [their dog]. When I returned I kissed Shumdit better and then began to attack again. Then we kissed it all better again.  3 June 1966  I had only one shot to do this morning but, malheureusement, Eliz had three, then of course she had to wash her hair for the weekend so we got away from the studio at 1.30. Down to Corsetti’s for lunch – a delicious sole from the Adriatic and Eliz a sea-bass, all with french fries and washed down by two bottles of Fontana Candida – a nice white cold wine from Frascati. […] I was asleep by 9pm. Made myself some cabbage soup at 2am and was joined by Bon Apetito [ET]. We eat from the same bowl like two pups.  24 September 1966 – Italy  We are down at Tor Vaianica. She cooks, I clean – a little. She does hot dogs and hamburgers and omelettes and soup. I do salads and I clean – a little. Apart from people staring and the occasional autograph we are not much bothered. One fat young girl last weekend asked me to autograph her behind – only barely covered by a bikini. I declined and signed her arm instead.  3 November 1966   For some reason I worried a lot about E this morning, whether she loved me or not and how awful it would be to lose her etc. I worked myself up into a rare state of misery and was absurdly relieved when she telephoned from the studio. What’s the matter with me?  10 January 1967  I am madly “in love” with her at the moment, as distinct from always loving her, and want to make love to her every minute but alas it is not possible for a couple of days. She’ll have trouble walking in a couple or three days.  24 May 1967 – Portofino  E anxious I write about her [in the diary] so here goes: She is a nice fat girl who loves mosquitoes and hates pustular carbuncular Welshmen, loathes boats and loves planes, has tiny blackcurrant eyes and minute breasts and has no sense of humour. She is prudish, priggish and painfully self-conscious.  30 July 1967 – Taormina  A slow day, marking time, with a walk in which we bought sunglasses at a little shop. As we left the crowd which had gathered applauded us. E thought it very sweet, which indeed it was. We dined in somnolence and some self-satisfaction as we compared our ancestors and former wives and husbands.  E has become very slim and I can barely keep my hands off her. It turns out that she’s not that less in weight but, as a result of massage and exercise the weight has been redistributed. She is at the moment among the most dishiest girls I’ve ever seen. The most. I mean dishiest.  30 September 1967 – Paris – Capo Caccia  At 12 noon I did something beyond outrage. I bought Elizabeth the jet plane we flew in yesterday. It costs, brand new, $960,000. She was not displeased.  26 September 1968 – Paris  We worked from seven last night to approx four this morning. […] Elizabeth has gone off to work and “test” costumes. She should be back before I leave I hope. After seven or is it eight years I still miss her if she goes to the bathroom.  8 November 1968  After completing yesterday’s entry with milady fast asleep in bed as I thought, I was looking through some scenes in the script when suddenly the bedroom door opened and standing there in a near diaphanous nightgown with one shoulder slipped on to her arm was E. So I went back to bed for 10 minutes. I was unquestionably seduced and I teased her about it for the rest of the day when we talked on the telephone. She was very beautiful. It is a fact that after all these years the girl can still blush. I lost that latter capacity a long long time ago.  10 November 1968  I am now 43. It’s nine in the morning. The sky is grey but it has a look of turning into sunshine later on. Yesterday was wholly delightful. We drank vodka screwdrivers, but not too many. E and I played gin rummy for $1,000 a point. I won $648,000! I refused to accept a cheque. It has to be paid in kind, I said.  19 November 1968 – Paris   Famed as we are, rich as we are, courted and insulted as we are, overpaid as we are, centre of a great deal of attention as we are, [we] are not bored or blasé. We are not envious. We are merely lucky.  I have been inordinately lucky all my life but the greatest luck of all has been Elizabeth. She has turned me into a moral man but not a prig, she is a wildly exciting lover-mistress, she is shy and witty, she is nobody’s fool, she is a brilliant actress, she is beautiful beyond the dreams of pornography, she can be arrogant and wilful, she is clement and loving, Dulcis Imperatrix, she is Sunday’s child, she can tolerate my impossibilities and my drunkenness, she is an ache in the stomach when I am away from her, and she loves me!  22 December 1968 – Gstaad  We arrived yesterday in furious fettle. I was in one of my absolutely unstoppably filthy moods, insulting everybody right left and centre. Elizabeth screamed a bit. I accused her of being a hypochondriac, that she was only ill when she chose to be. How odd, I said, that when you were in Paris and had to work you were unable to move, but once here in Gstaad you’re gambolling around like a spring lamb etc etc. And I couldn’t keep away from the subject. It’s like a bloke who nearly kills a child in his car and then smacks it for frightening him. I shout at E out of fear for her health. I rarely think of anything else.  29 March 1969 – Puerto Vallarta  Elizabeth is now looking ravishingly sun-tanned though the lazy little b------ ought to lose a few pounds to look at her absolute best. Looking as critically as I can I detect no sign of ageing in her at all except that she has quite a few grey hairs. Her skin is as smooth and as youthful and unwrinkled as it ever was. The breasts, despite their largeness and considerable weight, sag very slightly but no more than they did 10 years ago. Her bottom is firm and round. She needs weight off her stomach, but she swam quite a lot yesterday and if she keeps that up she should be quite firm by the time we get back to London. Dreadful thought, London.  4 April 1969  Yesterday was a funny day. It went splendidly for the first half and degenerated into bickering around 3.30 in the pm. It was largely my fault. E of course was no help at all and bickered back with almost masculine pride. This was some of the dialogue, roughly speaking:  Me: (having gone to read upstairs in the bedroom about 8pm) “Is the bathroom still smelling?”  She: “Yes.”  Me: “I can’t smell anything in there. Perhaps it’s you.”  She: “F--- off.” (She leaves bedroom and goes downstairs while me remains reading on bed.)  She: (having come back upstairs 20 minutes or so later standing at the doorway with a look of real loathing on her face) “I dislike you and hate you.”  Me: (getting into dressing gown) “Goodnight, have a good sleep.”  She: “You too.”  NB: For the benefit of [readers of] this little study of home life among the Burtons, it must be emphasised that though the words used are innocuous, the speaking of them is instinct with venomous malice.  25 May 1969  What an extraordinary world it is. How do you live with one person for 13 years, and another for eight and find both as alien as strangers. Elizabeth is an eternal one night stand. She is my private and personal bought mistress. And lascivious with it. It is impossible to tell you what is consisted in the act of love. Well I’ll tell you, E is a receiver, a perpetual returner of the ball! I don’t write about sex very often, because it embarrasses me, but, but…  6 August 1969  E said this morning that I lacked loyalty. Now she is a bright b----- to talk about loyalty. The list of her dis‑loyalties would fill the yellow pages of the New York Telephone Directory. Except of course to her children. And there she defeats me because I've been disloyal to mine.  31 August 1969 – Sunday morning  Yesterday was another terrible day. I behaved in a way to make a banshee look kind good and sweet. Insulting Elizabeth, drunk, periodically excusing myself rather shabbily and then starting the rough treatment all over again. Sometimes I am so much my father’s son that I give myself occasional creeps. He had the same gift for damaging with the tongue, he had the same temporary violence, he had the same fidelity to mam that I have to Elizabeth, he had the same smattering of scholarship, he had the same didactitism (bet I spelled that wrong), we wave the same admonitory finger at innocence when we know bloody well when we are guilt-ridden.  Time to wake up Maisie [ET]. Life is a waste without her.  2 October 1969 – Geneva  When we came out of the Musée des Beaux Arts the cab driver had vanished, but he returned a few minutes later having very sweetly bought a single rose for Elizabeth. Somewhere between [then] and dinner, brooding set in. Between long silences deadly insults were hurled. At one point E knowing I was in a state of nastiness said to me: “Come on Richard, hold my hand.” Me: “I do not wish to touch your hands. They are large and ugly and red and masculine.” Or words to that effect.  This morning E said that I really must get her the 69-carat ring to make her ugly big hands look smaller and less ugly! Nobody turns insults to her advantage more swiftly or more cleverly than Lady Elizabeth.  18 November 1969 – Monaco  This morning in the early hours the pot decided to have a go at the kettle and won handle down. E, the pot, gave this particular kettle, me, a savage mauling. I was coldly accused of virtually every sin under the sun. Drunkenness (true) mendacity (true) being boring (true) infidelity (untrue) killing myself fairly quickly (true) pride envy avarice (all true) being ugly (true) having once been handsome (untrue) and any other vice imaginable except homosexuality and ungenerousness.  29 March 1970 – Mexico  For E and I there is a kind of armistice. Both sides are fully armed, the bombs are ready to go off but so far nobody has pressed the button. The first six months of our sabbatical have been completely wasted. Except when we were alone we have bickered and quarrelled incessantly, and we have hardly ever been alone. Anyway back to work soon thank God.  3 July 1970 – location filming in Mexico  Drove into Mexicali yesterday, took a room for the day at the Lucerna Hotel, phoned Elizabeth. It was delicious talking to her. So for the first time in my life I appreciated the normally despised telephone. I talked to her twice in a couple of hours! She said she missed me as badly as I missed her and she mooned about at night and felt almost tearful over a pair of my socks that she saw hanging about.  9 February 1972 – Budapest   E and I did our going to bed exercises last night together. It is especially droll when we do running on the spot as she has to hold her breasts – one hand on each – for firm as they are, they are pretty big and the resultant wiggle-waggle is a pretty fetching sight and were it open to the public it would fetch in a lot of people. Like 10 million.  Burton’s diaries end in March 1972, and continue only in occasional fragments after 1975. In the intervening years, he and Taylor divorced. They remarried each other 16 months later, on 10 October 1975:  6 October 1975 – Johannesburg  E in splendid form. When she said we should get married in Chobe this week I thought she was joking. But she turned out to be serious. Result the latter half of the day a series of ½ joking ½ bitter invective from E. I told her that I was afraid! Literally afraid, at the moment, that marriage might horrifyingly end in divorce. We will of course get married again if E so wishes but until I get over my fear and since I am, at least, deliriously happy at the moment why spoil it!  7 October 1975 – Johannesburg – Chobe   Grass landing. Slight brush with grim reaper. Left suspension, left wheel packed it in. Guess that we were within 6–8–12 inches from kingdom come. Decided to get married here as soon as possible unless E (or I, for that matter) changes mind. Love her beyond measure and above anything. She fast asleep. Shiver, shiver, shake shake. Can’t wait for E to awaken!  10 October 1975  Got shamefully sloshed and despite all my idiocies – nasty too – we are as happy as children. We catch our breaths every so often and say with a kind of smiling wonder and delight “Hey! Do you realise we are actually married?” We must have said it scores of times. I have never been so happy in my life. E cured me with loving even lavish attention. This is far better marriage than the first despite its silly (and dangerous) beginning.  Burton and Taylor divorced for the second time less than a year after the wedding in Chobe. Their story resumes in 1983, when they are due to appear together in a Broadway production of Noël Coward’s ‘Private Lives’. By this time Burton is in a relationship with Sally Hay, who would become his last wife.   13 March 1983 – New York  Went to see ET who is using Rock Hudson’s flat. Little or no library. Horrid flat. E’s face OK but figure aplop! Also drinking. Also has not yet read the play! That’s my girl. Became very sentimental. “Please don’t marry Sally for my sake for a long time.” “I have no dates.” She is very lonely. Feel sorry for her. A mass of mess. Poor thing. “I have no dates” means “Nobody wants me for myself.” True too!  14 March 1983 [in rehearsal]  ET still drinking. Wine only she says. Couldn’t even read the lines properly. This is going to be a long long seven months. ET beginning to bore, which I would not have thought possible all those years ago. How terrible a thing time is.  15 March 1983  ET only 15 minutes late but then spent 15 minutes more doing her eyebrows. She stinks of garlic – who eats garlic for breakfast? She is also on something or another because there are lines here and there which she can’t say at all [underlined]. Very worrying. Tells me twice an hour how lonely she is.  20 March 1983   Went to ET’s for brunch. Eggs Benedict, chips, peas. All had Mimosas except me. Ran through second act with ET abysmal. She was quite crocked by this time and couldn’t even read the lines let alone remember them. She gave me the terrors again. She is such a mess.  21 March 1983  ET no better. Sally saw her have a Fernet Branca at 12.30pm then she drank white wine quite openly. Because she’s struggling for words it makes for a very long day.  22 March 1983  ET impossibly sloshed all day long. So much so she couldn’t even read [underlined] the lines. In hating and hateable mood – an iron mouse. God were we glad to get home.  Richard Burton’s diary entries end in early April 1983. In July he married Sally, and on August 5 1984 he died in his sleep of a brain haemorrhage, at the age of 58.  ‘The Richard Burton Diaries’, edited by Chris Williams, are published by Yale (£25) and available from Telegraph Bookshop.

Richard Burton Diaries: 'I behaved with disgrace'

17 Sep 2012



 What a day! I went in at about 11.30 to see the test of the new costume [for Franco Zeffirelli’s Taming of the Shrew]. It was alright – at least it was better than the other. At lunch I was so exasperated that I left the table snarling, “You’ll excuse me, I’m in a bad mood.” Shumdit [ET] said with her usual immense tact, “Really, Richard?” I snarled again something witty like “Shut your mouth” and went tramping furiously over our few acres with E’en So [their dog]. When I returned I kissed Shumdit better and then began to attack again. Then we kissed it all better again.  3 June 1966  I had only one shot to do this morning but, malheureusement, Eliz had three, then of course she had to wash her hair for the weekend so we got away from the studio at 1.30.

She should be back before I leave I hope.

She said she missed me as badly as I missed her and she mooned about at night and felt almost tearful over a pair of my socks that she saw hanging about.  9 February 1972 – Budapest   E and I did our going to bed exercises last night together. It is especially droll when we do running on the spot as she has to hold her breasts – one hand on each – for firm as they are, they are pretty big and the resultant wiggle-waggle is a pretty fetching sight and were it open to the public it would fetch in a lot of people. Like 10 million.  Burton’s diaries end in March 1972, and continue only in occasional fragments after 1975. In the intervening years, he and Taylor divorced. They remarried each other 16 months later, on 10 October 1975:  6 October 1975 – Johannesburg  E in splendid form. When she said we should get married in Chobe this week I thought she was joking. But she turned out to be serious. Result the latter half of the day a series of ½ joking ½ bitter invective from E. I told her that I was afraid! Literally afraid, at the moment, that marriage might horrifyingly end in divorce. We will of course get married again if E so wishes but until I get over my fear and since I am, at least, deliriously happy at the moment why spoil it!  7 October 1975 – Johannesburg – Chobe   Grass landing. Slight brush with grim reaper. Left suspension, left wheel packed it in. Guess that we were within 6–8–12 inches from kingdom come. Decided to get married here as soon as possible unless E (or I, for that matter) changes mind. Love her beyond measure and above anything. She fast asleep. Shiver, shiver, shake shake. Can’t wait for E to awaken!  10 October 1975  Got shamefully sloshed and despite all my idiocies – nasty too – we are as happy as children. We catch our breaths every so often and say with a kind of smiling wonder and delight “Hey! Do you realise we are actually married?” We must have said it scores of times. I have never been so happy in my life. E cured me with loving even lavish attention. This is far better marriage than the first despite its silly (and dangerous) beginning.  Burton and Taylor divorced for the second time less than a year after the wedding in Chobe. Their story resumes in 1983, when they are due to appear together in a Broadway production of Noël Coward’s ‘Private Lives’. By this time Burton is in a relationship with Sally Hay, who would become his last wife.   13 March 1983 – New York  Went to see ET who is using Rock Hudson’s flat. Little or no library. Horrid flat. E’s face OK but figure aplop! Also drinking. Also has not yet read the play! That’s my girl. Became very sentimental. “Please don’t marry Sally for my sake for a long time.” “I have no dates.” She is very lonely. Feel sorry for her. A mass of mess. Poor thing. “I have no dates” means “Nobody wants me for myself.” True too!  14 March 1983 [in rehearsal]  ET still drinking. Wine only she says. Couldn’t even read the lines properly. This is going to be a long long seven months. ET beginning to bore, which I would not have thought possible all those years ago. How terrible a thing time is.  15 March 1983  ET only 15 minutes late but then spent 15 minutes more doing her eyebrows. She stinks of garlic – who eats garlic for breakfast? She is also on something or another because there are lines here and there which she can’t say at all [underlined]. Very worrying. Tells me twice an hour how lonely she is.  20 March 1983   Went to ET’s for brunch. Eggs Benedict, chips, peas. All had Mimosas except me. Ran through second act with ET abysmal. She was quite crocked by this time and couldn’t even read the lines let alone remember them. She gave me the terrors again. She is such a mess.  21 March 1983  ET no better. Sally saw her have a Fernet Branca at 12.30pm then she drank white wine quite openly. Because she’s struggling for words it makes for a very long day.  22 March 1983  ET impossibly sloshed all day long. So much so she couldn’t even read [underlined] the lines. In hating and hateable mood – an iron mouse. God were we glad to get home.  Richard Burton’s diary entries end in early April 1983. In July he married Sally, and on August 5 1984 he died in his sleep of a brain haemorrhage, at the age of 58.  ‘The Richard Burton Diaries’, edited by Chris Williams, are published by Yale (£25) and available from Telegraph Bookshop.

Richard Burton Diaries: ‘Elizabeth is an eternal one night stand’

In our exclusive extracts from the diaries of Richard Burton, he candidly 
  charts his relationship with Elizabeth Taylor, his ‘wildly exciting 
  lover-mistress’, in all its passionate, volatile glory

							By Richard Burton

11:14AM BST 17 Sep 2012
 


 2 June 1965  Rose [at] 10 o’clock but weather dull. Had a good row with Burt [Elizabeth Taylor] and accused her, among other things, of lousy taste. She accused me among other things of snobbery. I said the only thing we had in common was Yahtsee. I forgot some other things.  20 March 1966  We had lunch with Vittorio De Sica and his wife and two children (boys). One boy played the guitar – what a horrible instrument, worse than a mouth-accordion, or a paper-and-comb. But De Sica really looked on his son with admiration. He had the face of a demented and somewhat stupefied fish. And so the day wore on inevitably to another regret in the lost and in the future to be recalled days. What shall we do now. B----- it then. Let’s row.  1 April 1966

Richard Burton Diaries: 'I behaved with disgrace'

17 Sep 2012



 What a day! I went in at about 11.30 to see the test of the new costume [for Franco Zeffirelli’s Taming of the Shrew]. It was alright – at least it was better than the other. At lunch I was so exasperated that I left the table snarling, “You’ll excuse me, I’m in a bad mood.” Shumdit [ET] said with her usual immense tact, “Really, Richard?” I snarled again something witty like “Shut your mouth” and went tramping furiously over our few acres with E’en So [their dog]. When I returned I kissed Shumdit better and then began to attack again. Then we kissed it all better again.  3 June 1966  I had only one shot to do this morning but, malheureusement, Eliz had three, then of course she had to wash her hair for the weekend so we got away from the studio at 1.30. Down to Corsetti’s for lunch – a delicious sole from the Adriatic and Eliz a sea-bass, all with french fries and washed down by two bottles of Fontana Candida – a nice white cold wine from Frascati. […] I was asleep by 9pm. Made myself some cabbage soup at 2am and was joined by Bon Apetito [ET]. We eat from the same bowl like two pups.  24 September 1966 – Italy  We are down at Tor Vaianica. She cooks, I clean – a little. She does hot dogs and hamburgers and omelettes and soup. I do salads and I clean – a little. Apart from people staring and the occasional autograph we are not much bothered. One fat young girl last weekend asked me to autograph her behind – only barely covered by a bikini. I declined and signed her arm instead.  3 November 1966   For some reason I worried a lot about E this morning, whether she loved me or not and how awful it would be to lose her etc. I worked myself up into a rare state of misery and was absurdly relieved when she telephoned from the studio. What’s the matter with me?  10 January 1967  I am madly “in love” with her at the moment, as distinct from always loving her, and want to make love to her every minute but alas it is not possible for a couple of days. She’ll have trouble walking in a couple or three days.  24 May 1967 – Portofino  E anxious I write about her [in the diary] so here goes: She is a nice fat girl who loves mosquitoes and hates pustular carbuncular Welshmen, loathes boats and loves planes, has tiny blackcurrant eyes and minute breasts and has no sense of humour. She is prudish, priggish and painfully self-conscious.  30 July 1967 – Taormina  A slow day, marking time, with a walk in which we bought sunglasses at a little shop. As we left the crowd which had gathered applauded us. E thought it very sweet, which indeed it was. We dined in somnolence and some self-satisfaction as we compared our ancestors and former wives and husbands.  E has become very slim and I can barely keep my hands off her. It turns out that she’s not that less in weight but, as a result of massage and exercise the weight has been redistributed. She is at the moment among the most dishiest girls I’ve ever seen. The most. I mean dishiest.  30 September 1967 – Paris – Capo Caccia  At 12 noon I did something beyond outrage. I bought Elizabeth the jet plane we flew in yesterday. It costs, brand new, $960,000. She was not displeased.  26 September 1968 – Paris  We worked from seven last night to approx four this morning. […] Elizabeth has gone off to work and “test” costumes. She should be back before I leave I hope. After seven or is it eight years I still miss her if she goes to the bathroom.  8 November 1968  After completing yesterday’s entry with milady fast asleep in bed as I thought, I was looking through some scenes in the script when suddenly the bedroom door opened and standing there in a near diaphanous nightgown with one shoulder slipped on to her arm was E. So I went back to bed for 10 minutes. I was unquestionably seduced and I teased her about it for the rest of the day when we talked on the telephone. She was very beautiful. It is a fact that after all these years the girl can still blush. I lost that latter capacity a long long time ago.  10 November 1968  I am now 43. It’s nine in the morning. The sky is grey but it has a look of turning into sunshine later on. Yesterday was wholly delightful. We drank vodka screwdrivers, but not too many. E and I played gin rummy for $1,000 a point. I won $648,000! I refused to accept a cheque. It has to be paid in kind, I said.  19 November 1968 – Paris   Famed as we are, rich as we are, courted and insulted as we are, overpaid as we are, centre of a great deal of attention as we are, [we] are not bored or blasé. We are not envious. We are merely lucky.  I have been inordinately lucky all my life but the greatest luck of all has been Elizabeth. She has turned me into a moral man but not a prig, she is a wildly exciting lover-mistress, she is shy and witty, she is nobody’s fool, she is a brilliant actress, she is beautiful beyond the dreams of pornography, she can be arrogant and wilful, she is clement and loving, Dulcis Imperatrix, she is Sunday’s child, she can tolerate my impossibilities and my drunkenness, she is an ache in the stomach when I am away from her, and she loves me!  22 December 1968 – Gstaad  We arrived yesterday in furious fettle. I was in one of my absolutely unstoppably filthy moods, insulting everybody right left and centre. Elizabeth screamed a bit. I accused her of being a hypochondriac, that she was only ill when she chose to be. How odd, I said, that when you were in Paris and had to work you were unable to move, but once here in Gstaad you’re gambolling around like a spring lamb etc etc. And I couldn’t keep away from the subject. It’s like a bloke who nearly kills a child in his car and then smacks it for frightening him. I shout at E out of fear for her health. I rarely think of anything else.  29 March 1969 – Puerto Vallarta  Elizabeth is now looking ravishingly sun-tanned though the lazy little b------ ought to lose a few pounds to look at her absolute best. Looking as critically as I can I detect no sign of ageing in her at all except that she has quite a few grey hairs. Her skin is as smooth and as youthful and unwrinkled as it ever was. The breasts, despite their largeness and considerable weight, sag very slightly but no more than they did 10 years ago. Her bottom is firm and round. She needs weight off her stomach, but she swam quite a lot yesterday and if she keeps that up she should be quite firm by the time we get back to London. Dreadful thought, London.  4 April 1969  Yesterday was a funny day. It went splendidly for the first half and degenerated into bickering around 3.30 in the pm. It was largely my fault. E of course was no help at all and bickered back with almost masculine pride. This was some of the dialogue, roughly speaking:  Me: (having gone to read upstairs in the bedroom about 8pm) “Is the bathroom still smelling?”  She: “Yes.”  Me: “I can’t smell anything in there. Perhaps it’s you.”  She: “F--- off.” (She leaves bedroom and goes downstairs while me remains reading on bed.)  She: (having come back upstairs 20 minutes or so later standing at the doorway with a look of real loathing on her face) “I dislike you and hate you.”  Me: (getting into dressing gown) “Goodnight, have a good sleep.”  She: “You too.”  NB: For the benefit of [readers of] this little study of home life among the Burtons, it must be emphasised that though the words used are innocuous, the speaking of them is instinct with venomous malice.  25 May 1969  What an extraordinary world it is. How do you live with one person for 13 years, and another for eight and find both as alien as strangers. Elizabeth is an eternal one night stand. She is my private and personal bought mistress. And lascivious with it. It is impossible to tell you what is consisted in the act of love. Well I’ll tell you, E is a receiver, a perpetual returner of the ball! I don’t write about sex very often, because it embarrasses me, but, but…  6 August 1969  E said this morning that I lacked loyalty. Now she is a bright b----- to talk about loyalty. The list of her dis‑loyalties would fill the yellow pages of the New York Telephone Directory. Except of course to her children. And there she defeats me because I've been disloyal to mine.  31 August 1969 – Sunday morning  Yesterday was another terrible day. I behaved in a way to make a banshee look kind good and sweet. Insulting Elizabeth, drunk, periodically excusing myself rather shabbily and then starting the rough treatment all over again. Sometimes I am so much my father’s son that I give myself occasional creeps. He had the same gift for damaging with the tongue, he had the same temporary violence, he had the same fidelity to mam that I have to Elizabeth, he had the same smattering of scholarship, he had the same didactitism (bet I spelled that wrong), we wave the same admonitory finger at innocence when we know bloody well when we are guilt-ridden.  Time to wake up Maisie [ET]. Life is a waste without her.  2 October 1969 – Geneva  When we came out of the Musée des Beaux Arts the cab driver had vanished, but he returned a few minutes later having very sweetly bought a single rose for Elizabeth. Somewhere between [then] and dinner, brooding set in. Between long silences deadly insults were hurled. At one point E knowing I was in a state of nastiness said to me: “Come on Richard, hold my hand.” Me: “I do not wish to touch your hands. They are large and ugly and red and masculine.” Or words to that effect.  This morning E said that I really must get her the 69-carat ring to make her ugly big hands look smaller and less ugly! Nobody turns insults to her advantage more swiftly or more cleverly than Lady Elizabeth.  18 November 1969 – Monaco  This morning in the early hours the pot decided to have a go at the kettle and won handle down. E, the pot, gave this particular kettle, me, a savage mauling. I was coldly accused of virtually every sin under the sun. Drunkenness (true) mendacity (true) being boring (true) infidelity (untrue) killing myself fairly quickly (true) pride envy avarice (all true) being ugly (true) having once been handsome (untrue) and any other vice imaginable except homosexuality and ungenerousness.  29 March 1970 – Mexico  For E and I there is a kind of armistice. Both sides are fully armed, the bombs are ready to go off but so far nobody has pressed the button. The first six months of our sabbatical have been completely wasted. Except when we were alone we have bickered and quarrelled incessantly, and we have hardly ever been alone. Anyway back to work soon thank God.  3 July 1970 – location filming in Mexico  Drove into Mexicali yesterday, took a room for the day at the Lucerna Hotel, phoned Elizabeth. It was delicious talking to her. So for the first time in my life I appreciated the normally despised telephone. I talked to her twice in a couple of hours! She said she missed me as badly as I missed her and she mooned about at night and felt almost tearful over a pair of my socks that she saw hanging about.  9 February 1972 – Budapest   E and I did our going to bed exercises last night together. It is especially droll when we do running on the spot as she has to hold her breasts – one hand on each – for firm as they are, they are pretty big and the resultant wiggle-waggle is a pretty fetching sight and were it open to the public it would fetch in a lot of people. Like 10 million.  Burton’s diaries end in March 1972, and continue only in occasional fragments after 1975. In the intervening years, he and Taylor divorced. They remarried each other 16 months later, on 10 October 1975:  6 October 1975 – Johannesburg  E in splendid form. When she said we should get married in Chobe this week I thought she was joking. But she turned out to be serious. Result the latter half of the day a series of ½ joking ½ bitter invective from E. I told her that I was afraid! Literally afraid, at the moment, that marriage might horrifyingly end in divorce. We will of course get married again if E so wishes but until I get over my fear and since I am, at least, deliriously happy at the moment why spoil it!  7 October 1975 – Johannesburg – Chobe   Grass landing. Slight brush with grim reaper. Left suspension, left wheel packed it in. Guess that we were within 6–8–12 inches from kingdom come. Decided to get married here as soon as possible unless E (or I, for that matter) changes mind. Love her beyond measure and above anything. She fast asleep. Shiver, shiver, shake shake. Can’t wait for E to awaken!  10 October 1975  Got shamefully sloshed and despite all my idiocies – nasty too – we are as happy as children. We catch our breaths every so often and say with a kind of smiling wonder and delight “Hey! Do you realise we are actually married?” We must have said it scores of times. I have never been so happy in my life. E cured me with loving even lavish attention. This is far better marriage than the first despite its silly (and dangerous) beginning.  Burton and Taylor divorced for the second time less than a year after the wedding in Chobe. Their story resumes in 1983, when they are due to appear together in a Broadway production of Noël Coward’s ‘Private Lives’. By this time Burton is in a relationship with Sally Hay, who would become his last wife.   13 March 1983 – New York  Went to see ET who is using Rock Hudson’s flat. Little or no library. Horrid flat. E’s face OK but figure aplop! Also drinking. Also has not yet read the play! That’s my girl. Became very sentimental. “Please don’t marry Sally for my sake for a long time.” “I have no dates.” She is very lonely. Feel sorry for her. A mass of mess. Poor thing. “I have no dates” means “Nobody wants me for myself.” True too!  14 March 1983 [in rehearsal]  ET still drinking. Wine only she says. Couldn’t even read the lines properly. This is going to be a long long seven months. ET beginning to bore, which I would not have thought possible all those years ago. How terrible a thing time is.  15 March 1983  ET only 15 minutes late but then spent 15 minutes more doing her eyebrows. She stinks of garlic – who eats garlic for breakfast? She is also on something or another because there are lines here and there which she can’t say at all [underlined]. Very worrying. Tells me twice an hour how lonely she is.  20 March 1983   Went to ET’s for brunch. Eggs Benedict, chips, peas. All had Mimosas except me. Ran through second act with ET abysmal. She was quite crocked by this time and couldn’t even read the lines let alone remember them. She gave me the terrors again. She is such a mess.  21 March 1983  ET no better. Sally saw her have a Fernet Branca at 12.30pm then she drank white wine quite openly. Because she’s struggling for words it makes for a very long day.  22 March 1983  ET impossibly sloshed all day long. So much so she couldn’t even read [underlined] the lines. In hating and hateable mood – an iron mouse. God were we glad to get home.  Richard Burton’s diary entries end in early April 1983. In July he married Sally, and on August 5 1984 he died in his sleep of a brain haemorrhage, at the age of 58.  ‘The Richard Burton Diaries’, edited by Chris Williams, are published by Yale (£25) and available from Telegraph Bookshop.

 2 June 1965  Rose [at] 10 o’clock but weather dull. Had a good row with Burt [Elizabeth Taylor] and accused her, among other things, of lousy taste. She accused me among other things of snobbery. I said the only thing we had in common was Yahtsee. I forgot some other things.  20 March 1966  We had lunch with Vittorio De Sica and his wife and two children (boys). One boy played the guitar – what a horrible instrument, worse than a mouth-accordion, or a paper-and-comb. But De Sica really looked on his son with admiration. He had the face of a demented and somewhat stupefied fish. And so the day wore on inevitably to another regret in the lost and in the future to be recalled days. What shall we do now. B----- it then. Let’s row.  1 April 1966

Richard Burton Diaries: 'I behaved with disgrace'

17 Sep 2012



 What a day! I went in at about 11.30 to see the test of the new costume [for Franco Zeffirelli’s Taming of the Shrew]. It was alright – at least it was better than the other. At lunch I was so exasperated that I left the table snarling, “You’ll excuse me, I’m in a bad mood.” Shumdit [ET] said with her usual immense tact, “Really, Richard?” I snarled again something witty like “Shut your mouth” and went tramping furiously over our few acres with E’en So [their dog]. When I returned I kissed Shumdit better and then began to attack again. Then we kissed it all better again.  3 June 1966  I had only one shot to do this morning but, malheureusement, Eliz had three, then of course she had to wash her hair for the weekend so we got away from the studio at 1.30. Down to Corsetti’s for lunch – a delicious sole from the Adriatic and Eliz a sea-bass, all with french fries and washed down by two bottles of Fontana Candida – a nice white cold wine from Frascati. […] I was asleep by 9pm. Made myself some cabbage soup at 2am and was joined by Bon Apetito [ET]. We eat from the same bowl like two pups.  24 September 1966 – Italy  We are down at Tor Vaianica. She cooks, I clean – a little. She does hot dogs and hamburgers and omelettes and soup. I do salads and I clean – a little. Apart from people staring and the occasional autograph we are not much bothered. One fat young girl last weekend asked me to autograph her behind – only barely covered by a bikini. I declined and signed her arm instead.  3 November 1966   For some reason I worried a lot about E this morning, whether she loved me or not and how awful it would be to lose her etc. I worked myself up into a rare state of misery and was absurdly relieved when she telephoned from the studio. What’s the matter with me?  10 January 1967  I am madly “in love” with her at the moment, as distinct from always loving her, and want to make love to her every minute but alas it is not possible for a couple of days. She’ll have trouble walking in a couple or three days.  24 May 1967 – Portofino  E anxious I write about her [in the diary] so here goes: She is a nice fat girl who loves mosquitoes and hates pustular carbuncular Welshmen, loathes boats and loves planes, has tiny blackcurrant eyes and minute breasts and has no sense of humour. She is prudish, priggish and painfully self-conscious.  30 July 1967 – Taormina  A slow day, marking time, with a walk in which we bought sunglasses at a little shop. As we left the crowd which had gathered applauded us. E thought it very sweet, which indeed it was. We dined in somnolence and some self-satisfaction as we compared our ancestors and former wives and husbands.  E has become very slim and I can barely keep my hands off her. It turns out that she’s not that less in weight but, as a result of massage and exercise the weight has been redistributed. She is at the moment among the most dishiest girls I’ve ever seen. The most. I mean dishiest.  30 September 1967 – Paris – Capo Caccia  At 12 noon I did something beyond outrage. I bought Elizabeth the jet plane we flew in yesterday. It costs, brand new, $960,000. She was not displeased.  26 September 1968 – Paris  We worked from seven last night to approx four this morning. […] Elizabeth has gone off to work and “test” costumes. She should be back before I leave I hope. After seven or is it eight years I still miss her if she goes to the bathroom.  8 November 1968  After completing yesterday’s entry with milady fast asleep in bed as I thought, I was looking through some scenes in the script when suddenly the bedroom door opened and standing there in a near diaphanous nightgown with one shoulder slipped on to her arm was E. So I went back to bed for 10 minutes. I was unquestionably seduced and I teased her about it for the rest of the day when we talked on the telephone. She was very beautiful. It is a fact that after all these years the girl can still blush. I lost that latter capacity a long long time ago.  10 November 1968  I am now 43. It’s nine in the morning. The sky is grey but it has a look of turning into sunshine later on. Yesterday was wholly delightful. We drank vodka screwdrivers, but not too many. E and I played gin rummy for $1,000 a point. I won $648,000! I refused to accept a cheque. It has to be paid in kind, I said.  19 November 1968 – Paris   Famed as we are, rich as we are, courted and insulted as we are, overpaid as we are, centre of a great deal of attention as we are, [we] are not bored or blasé. We are not envious. We are merely lucky.  I have been inordinately lucky all my life but the greatest luck of all has been Elizabeth. She has turned me into a moral man but not a prig, she is a wildly exciting lover-mistress, she is shy and witty, she is nobody’s fool, she is a brilliant actress, she is beautiful beyond the dreams of pornography, she can be arrogant and wilful, she is clement and loving, Dulcis Imperatrix, she is Sunday’s child, she can tolerate my impossibilities and my drunkenness, she is an ache in the stomach when I am away from her, and she loves me!  22 December 1968 – Gstaad  We arrived yesterday in furious fettle. I was in one of my absolutely unstoppably filthy moods, insulting everybody right left and centre. Elizabeth screamed a bit. I accused her of being a hypochondriac, that she was only ill when she chose to be. How odd, I said, that when you were in Paris and had to work you were unable to move, but once here in Gstaad you’re gambolling around like a spring lamb etc etc. And I couldn’t keep away from the subject. It’s like a bloke who nearly kills a child in his car and then smacks it for frightening him. I shout at E out of fear for her health. I rarely think of anything else.  29 March 1969 – Puerto Vallarta  Elizabeth is now looking ravishingly sun-tanned though the lazy little b------ ought to lose a few pounds to look at her absolute best. Looking as critically as I can I detect no sign of ageing in her at all except that she has quite a few grey hairs. Her skin is as smooth and as youthful and unwrinkled as it ever was. The breasts, despite their largeness and considerable weight, sag very slightly but no more than they did 10 years ago. Her bottom is firm and round. She needs weight off her stomach, but she swam quite a lot yesterday and if she keeps that up she should be quite firm by the time we get back to London. Dreadful thought, London.  4 April 1969  Yesterday was a funny day. It went splendidly for the first half and degenerated into bickering around 3.30 in the pm. It was largely my fault. E of course was no help at all and bickered back with almost masculine pride. This was some of the dialogue, roughly speaking:  Me: (having gone to read upstairs in the bedroom about 8pm) “Is the bathroom still smelling?”  She: “Yes.”  Me: “I can’t smell anything in there. Perhaps it’s you.”  She: “F--- off.” (She leaves bedroom and goes downstairs while me remains reading on bed.)  She: (having come back upstairs 20 minutes or so later standing at the doorway with a look of real loathing on her face) “I dislike you and hate you.”  Me: (getting into dressing gown) “Goodnight, have a good sleep.”  She: “You too.”  NB: For the benefit of [readers of] this little study of home life among the Burtons, it must be emphasised that though the words used are innocuous, the speaking of them is instinct with venomous malice.  25 May 1969  What an extraordinary world it is. How do you live with one person for 13 years, and another for eight and find both as alien as strangers. Elizabeth is an eternal one night stand. She is my private and personal bought mistress. And lascivious with it. It is impossible to tell you what is consisted in the act of love. Well I’ll tell you, E is a receiver, a perpetual returner of the ball! I don’t write about sex very often, because it embarrasses me, but, but…  6 August 1969  E said this morning that I lacked loyalty. Now she is a bright b----- to talk about loyalty. The list of her dis‑loyalties would fill the yellow pages of the New York Telephone Directory. Except of course to her children. And there she defeats me because I've been disloyal to mine.  31 August 1969 – Sunday morning  Yesterday was another terrible day. I behaved in a way to make a banshee look kind good and sweet. Insulting Elizabeth, drunk, periodically excusing myself rather shabbily and then starting the rough treatment all over again. Sometimes I am so much my father’s son that I give myself occasional creeps. He had the same gift for damaging with the tongue, he had the same temporary violence, he had the same fidelity to mam that I have to Elizabeth, he had the same smattering of scholarship, he had the same didactitism (bet I spelled that wrong), we wave the same admonitory finger at innocence when we know bloody well when we are guilt-ridden.  Time to wake up Maisie [ET]. Life is a waste without her.  2 October 1969 – Geneva  When we came out of the Musée des Beaux Arts the cab driver had vanished, but he returned a few minutes later having very sweetly bought a single rose for Elizabeth. Somewhere between [then] and dinner, brooding set in. Between long silences deadly insults were hurled. At one point E knowing I was in a state of nastiness said to me: “Come on Richard, hold my hand.” Me: “I do not wish to touch your hands. They are large and ugly and red and masculine.” Or words to that effect.  This morning E said that I really must get her the 69-carat ring to make her ugly big hands look smaller and less ugly! Nobody turns insults to her advantage more swiftly or more cleverly than Lady Elizabeth.  18 November 1969 – Monaco  This morning in the early hours the pot decided to have a go at the kettle and won handle down. E, the pot, gave this particular kettle, me, a savage mauling. I was coldly accused of virtually every sin under the sun. Drunkenness (true) mendacity (true) being boring (true) infidelity (untrue) killing myself fairly quickly (true) pride envy avarice (all true) being ugly (true) having once been handsome (untrue) and any other vice imaginable except homosexuality and ungenerousness.  29 March 1970 – Mexico  For E and I there is a kind of armistice. Both sides are fully armed, the bombs are ready to go off but so far nobody has pressed the button. The first six months of our sabbatical have been completely wasted. Except when we were alone we have bickered and quarrelled incessantly, and we have hardly ever been alone. Anyway back to work soon thank God.  3 July 1970 – location filming in Mexico  Drove into Mexicali yesterday, took a room for the day at the Lucerna Hotel, phoned Elizabeth. It was delicious talking to her. So for the first time in my life I appreciated the normally despised telephone. I talked to her twice in a couple of hours! She said she missed me as badly as I missed her and she mooned about at night and felt almost tearful over a pair of my socks that she saw hanging about.  9 February 1972 – Budapest   E and I did our going to bed exercises last night together. It is especially droll when we do running on the spot as she has to hold her breasts – one hand on each – for firm as they are, they are pretty big and the resultant wiggle-waggle is a pretty fetching sight and were it open to the public it would fetch in a lot of people. Like 10 million.  Burton’s diaries end in March 1972, and continue only in occasional fragments after 1975. In the intervening years, he and Taylor divorced. They remarried each other 16 months later, on 10 October 1975:  6 October 1975 – Johannesburg  E in splendid form. When she said we should get married in Chobe this week I thought she was joking. But she turned out to be serious. Result the latter half of the day a series of ½ joking ½ bitter invective from E. I told her that I was afraid! Literally afraid, at the moment, that marriage might horrifyingly end in divorce. We will of course get married again if E so wishes but until I get over my fear and since I am, at least, deliriously happy at the moment why spoil it!  7 October 1975 – Johannesburg – Chobe   Grass landing. Slight brush with grim reaper. Left suspension, left wheel packed it in. Guess that we were within 6–8–12 inches from kingdom come. Decided to get married here as soon as possible unless E (or I, for that matter) changes mind. Love her beyond measure and above anything. She fast asleep. Shiver, shiver, shake shake. Can’t wait for E to awaken!  10 October 1975  Got shamefully sloshed and despite all my idiocies – nasty too – we are as happy as children. We catch our breaths every so often and say with a kind of smiling wonder and delight “Hey! Do you realise we are actually married?” We must have said it scores of times. I have never been so happy in my life. E cured me with loving even lavish attention. This is far better marriage than the first despite its silly (and dangerous) beginning.  Burton and Taylor divorced for the second time less than a year after the wedding in Chobe. Their story resumes in 1983, when they are due to appear together in a Broadway production of Noël Coward’s ‘Private Lives’. By this time Burton is in a relationship with Sally Hay, who would become his last wife.   13 March 1983 – New York  Went to see ET who is using Rock Hudson’s flat. Little or no library. Horrid flat. E’s face OK but figure aplop! Also drinking. Also has not yet read the play! That’s my girl. Became very sentimental. “Please don’t marry Sally for my sake for a long time.” “I have no dates.” She is very lonely. Feel sorry for her. A mass of mess. Poor thing. “I have no dates” means “Nobody wants me for myself.” True too!  14 March 1983 [in rehearsal]  ET still drinking. Wine only she says. Couldn’t even read the lines properly. This is going to be a long long seven months. ET beginning to bore, which I would not have thought possible all those years ago. How terrible a thing time is.  15 March 1983  ET only 15 minutes late but then spent 15 minutes more doing her eyebrows. She stinks of garlic – who eats garlic for breakfast? She is also on something or another because there are lines here and there which she can’t say at all [underlined]. Very worrying. Tells me twice an hour how lonely she is.  20 March 1983   Went to ET’s for brunch. Eggs Benedict, chips, peas. All had Mimosas except me. Ran through second act with ET abysmal. She was quite crocked by this time and couldn’t even read the lines let alone remember them. She gave me the terrors again. She is such a mess.  21 March 1983  ET no better. Sally saw her have a Fernet Branca at 12.30pm then she drank white wine quite openly. Because she’s struggling for words it makes for a very long day.  22 March 1983  ET impossibly sloshed all day long. So much so she couldn’t even read [underlined] the lines. In hating and hateable mood – an iron mouse. God were we glad to get home.  Richard Burton’s diary entries end in early April 1983. In July he married Sally, and on August 5 1984 he died in his sleep of a brain haemorrhage, at the age of 58.  ‘The Richard Burton Diaries’, edited by Chris Williams, are published by Yale (£25) and available from Telegraph Bookshop.

 2 June 1965  Rose [at] 10 o’clock but weather dull. Had a good row with Burt [Elizabeth Taylor] and accused her, among other things, of lousy taste. She accused me among other things of snobbery. I said the only thing we had in common was Yahtsee. I forgot some other things.  20 March 1966  We had lunch with Vittorio De Sica and his wife and two children (boys). One boy played the guitar – what a horrible instrument, worse than a mouth-accordion, or a paper-and-comb. But De Sica really looked on his son with admiration. He had the face of a demented and somewhat stupefied fish. And so the day wore on inevitably to another regret in the lost and in the future to be recalled days. What shall we do now. B----- it then. Let’s row.  1 April 1966

Richard Burton Diaries: 'I behaved with disgrace'

17 Sep 2012



 What a day! I went in at about 11.30 to see the test of the new costume [for Franco Zeffirelli’s Taming of the Shrew]. It was alright – at least it was better than the other. At lunch I was so exasperated that I left the table snarling, “You’ll excuse me, I’m in a bad mood.” Shumdit [ET] said with her usual immense tact, “Really, Richard?” I snarled again something witty like “Shut your mouth” and went tramping furiously over our few acres with E’en So [their dog]. When I returned I kissed Shumdit better and then began to attack again. Then we kissed it all better again.  3 June 1966  I had only one shot to do this morning but, malheureusement, Eliz had three, then of course she had to wash her hair for the weekend so we got away from the studio at 1.30. Down to Corsetti’s for lunch – a delicious sole from the Adriatic and Eliz a sea-bass, all with french fries and washed down by two bottles of Fontana Candida – a nice white cold wine from Frascati. […] I was asleep by 9pm. Made myself some cabbage soup at 2am and was joined by Bon Apetito [ET]. We eat from the same bowl like two pups.  24 September 1966 – Italy  We are down at Tor Vaianica. She cooks, I clean – a little. She does hot dogs and hamburgers and omelettes and soup. I do salads and I clean – a little. Apart from people staring and the occasional autograph we are not much bothered. One fat young girl last weekend asked me to autograph her behind – only barely covered by a bikini. I declined and signed her arm instead.  3 November 1966   For some reason I worried a lot about E this morning, whether she loved me or not and how awful it would be to lose her etc. I worked myself up into a rare state of misery and was absurdly relieved when she telephoned from the studio. What’s the matter with me?  10 January 1967  I am madly “in love” with her at the moment, as distinct from always loving her, and want to make love to her every minute but alas it is not possible for a couple of days. She’ll have trouble walking in a couple or three days.  24 May 1967 – Portofino  E anxious I write about her [in the diary] so here goes: She is a nice fat girl who loves mosquitoes and hates pustular carbuncular Welshmen, loathes boats and loves planes, has tiny blackcurrant eyes and minute breasts and has no sense of humour. She is prudish, priggish and painfully self-conscious.  30 July 1967 – Taormina  A slow day, marking time, with a walk in which we bought sunglasses at a little shop. As we left the crowd which had gathered applauded us. E thought it very sweet, which indeed it was. We dined in somnolence and some self-satisfaction as we compared our ancestors and former wives and husbands.  E has become very slim and I can barely keep my hands off her. It turns out that she’s not that less in weight but, as a result of massage and exercise the weight has been redistributed. She is at the moment among the most dishiest girls I’ve ever seen. The most. I mean dishiest.  30 September 1967 – Paris – Capo Caccia  At 12 noon I did something beyond outrage. I bought Elizabeth the jet plane we flew in yesterday. It costs, brand new, $960,000. She was not displeased.  26 September 1968 – Paris  We worked from seven last night to approx four this morning. […] Elizabeth has gone off to work and “test” costumes. She should be back before I leave I hope. After seven or is it eight years I still miss her if she goes to the bathroom.  8 November 1968  After completing yesterday’s entry with milady fast asleep in bed as I thought, I was looking through some scenes in the script when suddenly the bedroom door opened and standing there in a near diaphanous nightgown with one shoulder slipped on to her arm was E. So I went back to bed for 10 minutes. I was unquestionably seduced and I teased her about it for the rest of the day when we talked on the telephone. She was very beautiful. It is a fact that after all these years the girl can still blush. I lost that latter capacity a long long time ago.  10 November 1968  I am now 43. It’s nine in the morning. The sky is grey but it has a look of turning into sunshine later on. Yesterday was wholly delightful. We drank vodka screwdrivers, but not too many. E and I played gin rummy for $1,000 a point. I won $648,000! I refused to accept a cheque. It has to be paid in kind, I said.  19 November 1968 – Paris   Famed as we are, rich as we are, courted and insulted as we are, overpaid as we are, centre of a great deal of attention as we are, [we] are not bored or blasé. We are not envious. We are merely lucky.  I have been inordinately lucky all my life but the greatest luck of all has been Elizabeth. She has turned me into a moral man but not a prig, she is a wildly exciting lover-mistress, she is shy and witty, she is nobody’s fool, she is a brilliant actress, she is beautiful beyond the dreams of pornography, she can be arrogant and wilful, she is clement and loving, Dulcis Imperatrix, she is Sunday’s child, she can tolerate my impossibilities and my drunkenness, she is an ache in the stomach when I am away from her, and she loves me!  22 December 1968 – Gstaad  We arrived yesterday in furious fettle. I was in one of my absolutely unstoppably filthy moods, insulting everybody right left and centre. Elizabeth screamed a bit. I accused her of being a hypochondriac, that she was only ill when she chose to be. How odd, I said, that when you were in Paris and had to work you were unable to move, but once here in Gstaad you’re gambolling around like a spring lamb etc etc. And I couldn’t keep away from the subject. It’s like a bloke who nearly kills a child in his car and then smacks it for frightening him. I shout at E out of fear for her health. I rarely think of anything else.  29 March 1969 – Puerto Vallarta  Elizabeth is now looking ravishingly sun-tanned though the lazy little b------ ought to lose a few pounds to look at her absolute best. Looking as critically as I can I detect no sign of ageing in her at all except that she has quite a few grey hairs. Her skin is as smooth and as youthful and unwrinkled as it ever was. The breasts, despite their largeness and considerable weight, sag very slightly but no more than they did 10 years ago. Her bottom is firm and round. She needs weight off her stomach, but she swam quite a lot yesterday and if she keeps that up she should be quite firm by the time we get back to London. Dreadful thought, London.  4 April 1969  Yesterday was a funny day. It went splendidly for the first half and degenerated into bickering around 3.30 in the pm. It was largely my fault. E of course was no help at all and bickered back with almost masculine pride. This was some of the dialogue, roughly speaking:  Me: (having gone to read upstairs in the bedroom about 8pm) “Is the bathroom still smelling?”  She: “Yes.”  Me: “I can’t smell anything in there. Perhaps it’s you.”  She: “F--- off.” (She leaves bedroom and goes downstairs while me remains reading on bed.)  She: (having come back upstairs 20 minutes or so later standing at the doorway with a look of real loathing on her face) “I dislike you and hate you.”  Me: (getting into dressing gown) “Goodnight, have a good sleep.”  She: “You too.”  NB: For the benefit of [readers of] this little study of home life among the Burtons, it must be emphasised that though the words used are innocuous, the speaking of them is instinct with venomous malice.  25 May 1969  What an extraordinary world it is. How do you live with one person for 13 years, and another for eight and find both as alien as strangers. Elizabeth is an eternal one night stand. She is my private and personal bought mistress. And lascivious with it. It is impossible to tell you what is consisted in the act of love. Well I’ll tell you, E is a receiver, a perpetual returner of the ball! I don’t write about sex very often, because it embarrasses me, but, but…  6 August 1969  E said this morning that I lacked loyalty. Now she is a bright b----- to talk about loyalty. The list of her dis‑loyalties would fill the yellow pages of the New York Telephone Directory. Except of course to her children. And there she defeats me because I've been disloyal to mine.  31 August 1969 – Sunday morning  Yesterday was another terrible day. I behaved in a way to make a banshee look kind good and sweet. Insulting Elizabeth, drunk, periodically excusing myself rather shabbily and then starting the rough treatment all over again. Sometimes I am so much my father’s son that I give myself occasional creeps. He had the same gift for damaging with the tongue, he had the same temporary violence, he had the same fidelity to mam that I have to Elizabeth, he had the same smattering of scholarship, he had the same didactitism (bet I spelled that wrong), we wave the same admonitory finger at innocence when we know bloody well when we are guilt-ridden.  Time to wake up Maisie [ET]. Life is a waste without her.  2 October 1969 – Geneva  When we came out of the Musée des Beaux Arts the cab driver had vanished, but he returned a few minutes later having very sweetly bought a single rose for Elizabeth. Somewhere between [then] and dinner, brooding set in. Between long silences deadly insults were hurled. At one point E knowing I was in a state of nastiness said to me: “Come on Richard, hold my hand.” Me: “I do not wish to touch your hands. They are large and ugly and red and masculine.” Or words to that effect.  This morning E said that I really must get her the 69-carat ring to make her ugly big hands look smaller and less ugly! Nobody turns insults to her advantage more swiftly or more cleverly than Lady Elizabeth.  18 November 1969 – Monaco  This morning in the early hours the pot decided to have a go at the kettle and won handle down. E, the pot, gave this particular kettle, me, a savage mauling. I was coldly accused of virtually every sin under the sun. Drunkenness (true) mendacity (true) being boring (true) infidelity (untrue) killing myself fairly quickly (true) pride envy avarice (all true) being ugly (true) having once been handsome (untrue) and any other vice imaginable except homosexuality and ungenerousness.  29 March 1970 – Mexico  For E and I there is a kind of armistice. Both sides are fully armed, the bombs are ready to go off but so far nobody has pressed the button. The first six months of our sabbatical have been completely wasted. Except when we were alone we have bickered and quarrelled incessantly, and we have hardly ever been alone. Anyway back to work soon thank God.  3 July 1970 – location filming in Mexico  Drove into Mexicali yesterday, took a room for the day at the Lucerna Hotel, phoned Elizabeth. It was delicious talking to her. So for the first time in my life I appreciated the normally despised telephone. I talked to her twice in a couple of hours! She said she missed me as badly as I missed her and she mooned about at night and felt almost tearful over a pair of my socks that she saw hanging about.  9 February 1972 – Budapest   E and I did our going to bed exercises last night together. It is especially droll when we do running on the spot as she has to hold her breasts – one hand on each – for firm as they are, they are pretty big and the resultant wiggle-waggle is a pretty fetching sight and were it open to the public it would fetch in a lot of people. Like 10 million.  Burton’s diaries end in March 1972, and continue only in occasional fragments after 1975. In the intervening years, he and Taylor divorced. They remarried each other 16 months later, on 10 October 1975:  6 October 1975 – Johannesburg  E in splendid form. When she said we should get married in Chobe this week I thought she was joking. But she turned out to be serious. Result the latter half of the day a series of ½ joking ½ bitter invective from E. I told her that I was afraid! Literally afraid, at the moment, that marriage might horrifyingly end in divorce. We will of course get married again if E so wishes but until I get over my fear and since I am, at least, deliriously happy at the moment why spoil it!  7 October 1975 – Johannesburg – Chobe   Grass landing. Slight brush with grim reaper. Left suspension, left wheel packed it in. Guess that we were within 6–8–12 inches from kingdom come. Decided to get married here as soon as possible unless E (or I, for that matter) changes mind. Love her beyond measure and above anything. She fast asleep. Shiver, shiver, shake shake. Can’t wait for E to awaken!  10 October 1975  Got shamefully sloshed and despite all my idiocies – nasty too – we are as happy as children. We catch our breaths every so often and say with a kind of smiling wonder and delight “Hey! Do you realise we are actually married?” We must have said it scores of times. I have never been so happy in my life. E cured me with loving even lavish attention. This is far better marriage than the first despite its silly (and dangerous) beginning.  Burton and Taylor divorced for the second time less than a year after the wedding in Chobe. Their story resumes in 1983, when they are due to appear together in a Broadway production of Noël Coward’s ‘Private Lives’. By this time Burton is in a relationship with Sally Hay, who would become his last wife.   13 March 1983 – New York  Went to see ET who is using Rock Hudson’s flat. Little or no library. Horrid flat. E’s face OK but figure aplop! Also drinking. Also has not yet read the play! That’s my girl. Became very sentimental. “Please don’t marry Sally for my sake for a long time.” “I have no dates.” She is very lonely. Feel sorry for her. A mass of mess. Poor thing. “I have no dates” means “Nobody wants me for myself.” True too!  14 March 1983 [in rehearsal]  ET still drinking. Wine only she says. Couldn’t even read the lines properly. This is going to be a long long seven months. ET beginning to bore, which I would not have thought possible all those years ago. How terrible a thing time is.  15 March 1983  ET only 15 minutes late but then spent 15 minutes more doing her eyebrows. She stinks of garlic – who eats garlic for breakfast? She is also on something or another because there are lines here and there which she can’t say at all [underlined]. Very worrying. Tells me twice an hour how lonely she is.  20 March 1983   Went to ET’s for brunch. Eggs Benedict, chips, peas. All had Mimosas except me. Ran through second act with ET abysmal. She was quite crocked by this time and couldn’t even read the lines let alone remember them. She gave me the terrors again. She is such a mess.  21 March 1983  ET no better. Sally saw her have a Fernet Branca at 12.30pm then she drank white wine quite openly. Because she’s struggling for words it makes for a very long day.  22 March 1983  ET impossibly sloshed all day long. So much so she couldn’t even read [underlined] the lines. In hating and hateable mood – an iron mouse. God were we glad to get home.  Richard Burton’s diary entries end in early April 1983. In July he married Sally, and on August 5 1984 he died in his sleep of a brain haemorrhage, at the age of 58.  ‘The Richard Burton Diaries’, edited by Chris Williams, are published by Yale (£25) and available from Telegraph Bookshop.

 2 June 1965  Rose [at] 10 o’clock but weather dull. Had a good row with Burt [Elizabeth Taylor] and accused her, among other things, of lousy taste. She accused me among other things of snobbery. I said the only thing we had in common was Yahtsee. I forgot some other things.  20 March 1966  We had lunch with Vittorio De Sica and his wife and two children (boys). One boy played the guitar – what a horrible instrument, worse than a mouth-accordion, or a paper-and-comb. But De Sica really looked on his son with admiration. He had the face of a demented and somewhat stupefied fish. And so the day wore on inevitably to another regret in the lost and in the future to be recalled days. What shall we do now. B----- it then. Let’s row.  1 April 1966

Richard Burton Diaries: 'I behaved with disgrace'

17 Sep 2012



 What a day! I went in at about 11.30 to see the test of the new costume [for Franco Zeffirelli’s Taming of the Shrew]. It was alright – at least it was better than the other. At lunch I was so exasperated that I left the table snarling, “You’ll excuse me, I’m in a bad mood.” Shumdit [ET] said with her usual immense tact, “Really, Richard?” I snarled again something witty like “Shut your mouth” and went tramping furiously over our few acres with E’en So [their dog]. When I returned I kissed Shumdit better and then began to attack again. Then we kissed it all better again.  3 June 1966  I had only one shot to do this morning but, malheureusement, Eliz had three, then of course she had to wash her hair for the weekend so we got away from the studio at 1.30. Down to Corsetti’s for lunch – a delicious sole from the Adriatic and Eliz a sea-bass, all with french fries and washed down by two bottles of Fontana Candida – a nice white cold wine from Frascati. […] I was asleep by 9pm. Made myself some cabbage soup at 2am and was joined by Bon Apetito [ET]. We eat from the same bowl like two pups.  24 September 1966 – Italy  We are down at Tor Vaianica. She cooks, I clean – a little. She does hot dogs and hamburgers and omelettes and soup. I do salads and I clean – a little. Apart from people staring and the occasional autograph we are not much bothered. One fat young girl last weekend asked me to autograph her behind – only barely covered by a bikini. I declined and signed her arm instead.  3 November 1966   For some reason I worried a lot about E this morning, whether she loved me or not and how awful it would be to lose her etc. I worked myself up into a rare state of misery and was absurdly relieved when she telephoned from the studio. What’s the matter with me?  10 January 1967  I am madly “in love” with her at the moment, as distinct from always loving her, and want to make love to her every minute but alas it is not possible for a couple of days. She’ll have trouble walking in a couple or three days.  24 May 1967 – Portofino  E anxious I write about her [in the diary] so here goes: She is a nice fat girl who loves mosquitoes and hates pustular carbuncular Welshmen, loathes boats and loves planes, has tiny blackcurrant eyes and minute breasts and has no sense of humour. She is prudish, priggish and painfully self-conscious.  30 July 1967 – Taormina  A slow day, marking time, with a walk in which we bought sunglasses at a little shop. As we left the crowd which had gathered applauded us. E thought it very sweet, which indeed it was. We dined in somnolence and some self-satisfaction as we compared our ancestors and former wives and husbands.  E has become very slim and I can barely keep my hands off her. It turns out that she’s not that less in weight but, as a result of massage and exercise the weight has been redistributed. She is at the moment among the most dishiest girls I’ve ever seen. The most. I mean dishiest.  30 September 1967 – Paris – Capo Caccia  At 12 noon I did something beyond outrage. I bought Elizabeth the jet plane we flew in yesterday. It costs, brand new, $960,000. She was not displeased.  26 September 1968 – Paris  We worked from seven last night to approx four this morning. […] Elizabeth has gone off to work and “test” costumes. She should be back before I leave I hope. After seven or is it eight years I still miss her if she goes to the bathroom.  8 November 1968  After completing yesterday’s entry with milady fast asleep in bed as I thought, I was looking through some scenes in the script when suddenly the bedroom door opened and standing there in a near diaphanous nightgown with one shoulder slipped on to her arm was E. So I went back to bed for 10 minutes. I was unquestionably seduced and I teased her about it for the rest of the day when we talked on the telephone. She was very beautiful. It is a fact that after all these years the girl can still blush. I lost that latter capacity a long long time ago.  10 November 1968  I am now 43. It’s nine in the morning. The sky is grey but it has a look of turning into sunshine later on. Yesterday was wholly delightful. We drank vodka screwdrivers, but not too many. E and I played gin rummy for $1,000 a point. I won $648,000! I refused to accept a cheque. It has to be paid in kind, I said.  19 November 1968 – Paris   Famed as we are, rich as we are, courted and insulted as we are, overpaid as we are, centre of a great deal of attention as we are, [we] are not bored or blasé. We are not envious. We are merely lucky.  I have been inordinately lucky all my life but the greatest luck of all has been Elizabeth. She has turned me into a moral man but not a prig, she is a wildly exciting lover-mistress, she is shy and witty, she is nobody’s fool, she is a brilliant actress, she is beautiful beyond the dreams of pornography, she can be arrogant and wilful, she is clement and loving, Dulcis Imperatrix, she is Sunday’s child, she can tolerate my impossibilities and my drunkenness, she is an ache in the stomach when I am away from her, and she loves me!  22 December 1968 – Gstaad  We arrived yesterday in furious fettle. I was in one of my absolutely unstoppably filthy moods, insulting everybody right left and centre. Elizabeth screamed a bit. I accused her of being a hypochondriac, that she was only ill when she chose to be. How odd, I said, that when you were in Paris and had to work you were unable to move, but once here in Gstaad you’re gambolling around like a spring lamb etc etc. And I couldn’t keep away from the subject. It’s like a bloke who nearly kills a child in his car and then smacks it for frightening him. I shout at E out of fear for her health. I rarely think of anything else.  29 March 1969 – Puerto Vallarta  Elizabeth is now looking ravishingly sun-tanned though the lazy little b------ ought to lose a few pounds to look at her absolute best. Looking as critically as I can I detect no sign of ageing in her at all except that she has quite a few grey hairs. Her skin is as smooth and as youthful and unwrinkled as it ever was. The breasts, despite their largeness and considerable weight, sag very slightly but no more than they did 10 years ago. Her bottom is firm and round. She needs weight off her stomach, but she swam quite a lot yesterday and if she keeps that up she should be quite firm by the time we get back to London. Dreadful thought, London.  4 April 1969  Yesterday was a funny day. It went splendidly for the first half and degenerated into bickering around 3.30 in the pm. It was largely my fault. E of course was no help at all and bickered back with almost masculine pride. This was some of the dialogue, roughly speaking:  Me: (having gone to read upstairs in the bedroom about 8pm) “Is the bathroom still smelling?”  She: “Yes.”  Me: “I can’t smell anything in there. Perhaps it’s you.”  She: “F--- off.” (She leaves bedroom and goes downstairs while me remains reading on bed.)  She: (having come back upstairs 20 minutes or so later standing at the doorway with a look of real loathing on her face) “I dislike you and hate you.”  Me: (getting into dressing gown) “Goodnight, have a good sleep.”  She: “You too.”  NB: For the benefit of [readers of] this little study of home life among the Burtons, it must be emphasised that though the words used are innocuous, the speaking of them is instinct with venomous malice.  25 May 1969  What an extraordinary world it is. How do you live with one person for 13 years, and another for eight and find both as alien as strangers. Elizabeth is an eternal one night stand. She is my private and personal bought mistress. And lascivious with it. It is impossible to tell you what is consisted in the act of love. Well I’ll tell you, E is a receiver, a perpetual returner of the ball! I don’t write about sex very often, because it embarrasses me, but, but…  6 August 1969  E said this morning that I lacked loyalty. Now she is a bright b----- to talk about loyalty. The list of her dis‑loyalties would fill the yellow pages of the New York Telephone Directory. Except of course to her children. And there she defeats me because I've been disloyal to mine.  31 August 1969 – Sunday morning  Yesterday was another terrible day. I behaved in a way to make a banshee look kind good and sweet. Insulting Elizabeth, drunk, periodically excusing myself rather shabbily and then starting the rough treatment all over again. Sometimes I am so much my father’s son that I give myself occasional creeps. He had the same gift for damaging with the tongue, he had the same temporary violence, he had the same fidelity to mam that I have to Elizabeth, he had the same smattering of scholarship, he had the same didactitism (bet I spelled that wrong), we wave the same admonitory finger at innocence when we know bloody well when we are guilt-ridden.  Time to wake up Maisie [ET]. Life is a waste without her.  2 October 1969 – Geneva  When we came out of the Musée des Beaux Arts the cab driver had vanished, but he returned a few minutes later having very sweetly bought a single rose for Elizabeth. Somewhere between [then] and dinner, brooding set in. Between long silences deadly insults were hurled. At one point E knowing I was in a state of nastiness said to me: “Come on Richard, hold my hand.” Me: “I do not wish to touch your hands. They are large and ugly and red and masculine.” Or words to that effect.  This morning E said that I really must get her the 69-carat ring to make her ugly big hands look smaller and less ugly! Nobody turns insults to her advantage more swiftly or more cleverly than Lady Elizabeth.  18 November 1969 – Monaco  This morning in the early hours the pot decided to have a go at the kettle and won handle down. E, the pot, gave this particular kettle, me, a savage mauling. I was coldly accused of virtually every sin under the sun. Drunkenness (true) mendacity (true) being boring (true) infidelity (untrue) killing myself fairly quickly (true) pride envy avarice (all true) being ugly (true) having once been handsome (untrue) and any other vice imaginable except homosexuality and ungenerousness.  29 March 1970 – Mexico  For E and I there is a kind of armistice. Both sides are fully armed, the bombs are ready to go off but so far nobody has pressed the button. The first six months of our sabbatical have been completely wasted. Except when we were alone we have bickered and quarrelled incessantly, and we have hardly ever been alone. Anyway back to work soon thank God.  3 July 1970 – location filming in Mexico  Drove into Mexicali yesterday, took a room for the day at the Lucerna Hotel, phoned Elizabeth. It was delicious talking to her. So for the first time in my life I appreciated the normally despised telephone. I talked to her twice in a couple of hours! She said she missed me as badly as I missed her and she mooned about at night and felt almost tearful over a pair of my socks that she saw hanging about.  9 February 1972 – Budapest   E and I did our going to bed exercises last night together. It is especially droll when we do running on the spot as she has to hold her breasts – one hand on each – for firm as they are, they are pretty big and the resultant wiggle-waggle is a pretty fetching sight and were it open to the public it would fetch in a lot of people. Like 10 million.  Burton’s diaries end in March 1972, and continue only in occasional fragments after 1975. In the intervening years, he and Taylor divorced. They remarried each other 16 months later, on 10 October 1975:  6 October 1975 – Johannesburg  E in splendid form. When she said we should get married in Chobe this week I thought she was joking. But she turned out to be serious. Result the latter half of the day a series of ½ joking ½ bitter invective from E. I told her that I was afraid! Literally afraid, at the moment, that marriage might horrifyingly end in divorce. We will of course get married again if E so wishes but until I get over my fear and since I am, at least, deliriously happy at the moment why spoil it!  7 October 1975 – Johannesburg – Chobe   Grass landing. Slight brush with grim reaper. Left suspension, left wheel packed it in. Guess that we were within 6–8–12 inches from kingdom come. Decided to get married here as soon as possible unless E (or I, for that matter) changes mind. Love her beyond measure and above anything. She fast asleep. Shiver, shiver, shake shake. Can’t wait for E to awaken!  10 October 1975  Got shamefully sloshed and despite all my idiocies – nasty too – we are as happy as children. We catch our breaths every so often and say with a kind of smiling wonder and delight “Hey! Do you realise we are actually married?” We must have said it scores of times. I have never been so happy in my life. E cured me with loving even lavish attention. This is far better marriage than the first despite its silly (and dangerous) beginning.  Burton and Taylor divorced for the second time less than a year after the wedding in Chobe. Their story resumes in 1983, when they are due to appear together in a Broadway production of Noël Coward’s ‘Private Lives’. By this time Burton is in a relationship with Sally Hay, who would become his last wife.   13 March 1983 – New York  Went to see ET who is using Rock Hudson’s flat. Little or no library. Horrid flat. E’s face OK but figure aplop! Also drinking. Also has not yet read the play! That’s my girl. Became very sentimental. “Please don’t marry Sally for my sake for a long time.” “I have no dates.” She is very lonely. Feel sorry for her. A mass of mess. Poor thing. “I have no dates” means “Nobody wants me for myself.” True too!  14 March 1983 [in rehearsal]  ET still drinking. Wine only she says. Couldn’t even read the lines properly. This is going to be a long long seven months. ET beginning to bore, which I would not have thought possible all those years ago. How terrible a thing time is.  15 March 1983  ET only 15 minutes late but then spent 15 minutes more doing her eyebrows. She stinks of garlic – who eats garlic for breakfast? She is also on something or another because there are lines here and there which she can’t say at all [underlined]. Very worrying. Tells me twice an hour how lonely she is.  20 March 1983   Went to ET’s for brunch. Eggs Benedict, chips, peas. All had Mimosas except me. Ran through second act with ET abysmal. She was quite crocked by this time and couldn’t even read the lines let alone remember them. She gave me the terrors again. She is such a mess.  21 March 1983  ET no better. Sally saw her have a Fernet Branca at 12.30pm then she drank white wine quite openly. Because she’s struggling for words it makes for a very long day.  22 March 1983  ET impossibly sloshed all day long. So much so she couldn’t even read [underlined] the lines. In hating and hateable mood – an iron mouse. God were we glad to get home.  Richard Burton’s diary entries end in early April 1983. In July he married Sally, and on August 5 1984 he died in his sleep of a brain haemorrhage, at the age of 58.  ‘The Richard Burton Diaries’, edited by Chris Williams, are published by Yale (£25) and available from Telegraph Bookshop.

 2 June 1965  Rose [at] 10 o’clock but weather dull. Had a good row with Burt [Elizabeth Taylor] and accused her, among other things, of lousy taste. She accused me among other things of snobbery. I said the only thing we had in common was Yahtsee. I forgot some other things.  20 March 1966  We had lunch with Vittorio De Sica and his wife and two children (boys). One boy played the guitar – what a horrible instrument, worse than a mouth-accordion, or a paper-and-comb. But De Sica really looked on his son with admiration. He had the face of a demented and somewhat stupefied fish. And so the day wore on inevitably to another regret in the lost and in the future to be recalled days. What shall we do now. B----- it then. Let’s row.  1 April 1966

Richard Burton Diaries: 'I behaved with disgrace'

17 Sep 2012



 What a day! I went in at about 11.30 to see the test of the new costume [for Franco Zeffirelli’s Taming of the Shrew]. It was alright – at least it was better than the other. At lunch I was so exasperated that I left the table snarling, “You’ll excuse me, I’m in a bad mood.” Shumdit [ET] said with her usual immense tact, “Really, Richard?” I snarled again something witty like “Shut your mouth” and went tramping furiously over our few acres with E’en So [their dog]. When I returned I kissed Shumdit better and then began to attack again. Then we kissed it all better again.  3 June 1966  I had only one shot to do this morning but, malheureusement, Eliz had three, then of course she had to wash her hair for the weekend so we got away from the studio at 1.30. Down to Corsetti’s for lunch – a delicious sole from the Adriatic and Eliz a sea-bass, all with french fries and washed down by two bottles of Fontana Candida – a nice white cold wine from Frascati. […] I was asleep by 9pm. Made myself some cabbage soup at 2am and was joined by Bon Apetito [ET]. We eat from the same bowl like two pups.  24 September 1966 – Italy  We are down at Tor Vaianica. She cooks, I clean – a little. She does hot dogs and hamburgers and omelettes and soup. I do salads and I clean – a little. Apart from people staring and the occasional autograph we are not much bothered. One fat young girl last weekend asked me to autograph her behind – only barely covered by a bikini. I declined and signed her arm instead.  3 November 1966   For some reason I worried a lot about E this morning, whether she loved me or not and how awful it would be to lose her etc. I worked myself up into a rare state of misery and was absurdly relieved when she telephoned from the studio. What’s the matter with me?  10 January 1967  I am madly “in love” with her at the moment, as distinct from always loving her, and want to make love to her every minute but alas it is not possible for a couple of days. She’ll have trouble walking in a couple or three days.  24 May 1967 – Portofino  E anxious I write about her [in the diary] so here goes: She is a nice fat girl who loves mosquitoes and hates pustular carbuncular Welshmen, loathes boats and loves planes, has tiny blackcurrant eyes and minute breasts and has no sense of humour. She is prudish, priggish and painfully self-conscious.  30 July 1967 – Taormina  A slow day, marking time, with a walk in which we bought sunglasses at a little shop. As we left the crowd which had gathered applauded us. E thought it very sweet, which indeed it was. We dined in somnolence and some self-satisfaction as we compared our ancestors and former wives and husbands.  E has become very slim and I can barely keep my hands off her. It turns out that she’s not that less in weight but, as a result of massage and exercise the weight has been redistributed. She is at the moment among the most dishiest girls I’ve ever seen. The most. I mean dishiest.  30 September 1967 – Paris – Capo Caccia  At 12 noon I did something beyond outrage. I bought Elizabeth the jet plane we flew in yesterday. It costs, brand new, $960,000. She was not displeased.  26 September 1968 – Paris  We worked from seven last night to approx four this morning. […] Elizabeth has gone off to work and “test” costumes. She should be back before I leave I hope. After seven or is it eight years I still miss her if she goes to the bathroom.  8 November 1968  After completing yesterday’s entry with milady fast asleep in bed as I thought, I was looking through some scenes in the script when suddenly the bedroom door opened and standing there in a near diaphanous nightgown with one shoulder slipped on to her arm was E. So I went back to bed for 10 minutes. I was unquestionably seduced and I teased her about it for the rest of the day when we talked on the telephone. She was very beautiful. It is a fact that after all these years the girl can still blush. I lost that latter capacity a long long time ago.  10 November 1968  I am now 43. It’s nine in the morning. The sky is grey but it has a look of turning into sunshine later on. Yesterday was wholly delightful. We drank vodka screwdrivers, but not too many. E and I played gin rummy for $1,000 a point. I won $648,000! I refused to accept a cheque. It has to be paid in kind, I said.  19 November 1968 – Paris   Famed as we are, rich as we are, courted and insulted as we are, overpaid as we are, centre of a great deal of attention as we are, [we] are not bored or blasé. We are not envious. We are merely lucky.  I have been inordinately lucky all my life but the greatest luck of all has been Elizabeth. She has turned me into a moral man but not a prig, she is a wildly exciting lover-mistress, she is shy and witty, she is nobody’s fool, she is a brilliant actress, she is beautiful beyond the dreams of pornography, she can be arrogant and wilful, she is clement and loving, Dulcis Imperatrix, she is Sunday’s child, she can tolerate my impossibilities and my drunkenness, she is an ache in the stomach when I am away from her, and she loves me!  22 December 1968 – Gstaad  We arrived yesterday in furious fettle. I was in one of my absolutely unstoppably filthy moods, insulting everybody right left and centre. Elizabeth screamed a bit. I accused her of being a hypochondriac, that she was only ill when she chose to be. How odd, I said, that when you were in Paris and had to work you were unable to move, but once here in Gstaad you’re gambolling around like a spring lamb etc etc. And I couldn’t keep away from the subject. It’s like a bloke who nearly kills a child in his car and then smacks it for frightening him. I shout at E out of fear for her health. I rarely think of anything else.  29 March 1969 – Puerto Vallarta  Elizabeth is now looking ravishingly sun-tanned though the lazy little b------ ought to lose a few pounds to look at her absolute best. Looking as critically as I can I detect no sign of ageing in her at all except that she has quite a few grey hairs. Her skin is as smooth and as youthful and unwrinkled as it ever was. The breasts, despite their largeness and considerable weight, sag very slightly but no more than they did 10 years ago. Her bottom is firm and round. She needs weight off her stomach, but she swam quite a lot yesterday and if she keeps that up she should be quite firm by the time we get back to London. Dreadful thought, London.  4 April 1969  Yesterday was a funny day. It went splendidly for the first half and degenerated into bickering around 3.30 in the pm. It was largely my fault. E of course was no help at all and bickered back with almost masculine pride. This was some of the dialogue, roughly speaking:  Me: (having gone to read upstairs in the bedroom about 8pm) “Is the bathroom still smelling?”  She: “Yes.”  Me: “I can’t smell anything in there. Perhaps it’s you.”  She: “F--- off.” (She leaves bedroom and goes downstairs while me remains reading on bed.)  She: (having come back upstairs 20 minutes or so later standing at the doorway with a look of real loathing on her face) “I dislike you and hate you.”  Me: (getting into dressing gown) “Goodnight, have a good sleep.”  She: “You too.”  NB: For the benefit of [readers of] this little study of home life among the Burtons, it must be emphasised that though the words used are innocuous, the speaking of them is instinct with venomous malice.  25 May 1969  What an extraordinary world it is. How do you live with one person for 13 years, and another for eight and find both as alien as strangers. Elizabeth is an eternal one night stand. She is my private and personal bought mistress. And lascivious with it. It is impossible to tell you what is consisted in the act of love. Well I’ll tell you, E is a receiver, a perpetual returner of the ball! I don’t write about sex very often, because it embarrasses me, but, but…  6 August 1969  E said this morning that I lacked loyalty. Now she is a bright b----- to talk about loyalty. The list of her dis‑loyalties would fill the yellow pages of the New York Telephone Directory. Except of course to her children. And there she defeats me because I've been disloyal to mine.  31 August 1969 – Sunday morning  Yesterday was another terrible day. I behaved in a way to make a banshee look kind good and sweet. Insulting Elizabeth, drunk, periodically excusing myself rather shabbily and then starting the rough treatment all over again. Sometimes I am so much my father’s son that I give myself occasional creeps. He had the same gift for damaging with the tongue, he had the same temporary violence, he had the same fidelity to mam that I have to Elizabeth, he had the same smattering of scholarship, he had the same didactitism (bet I spelled that wrong), we wave the same admonitory finger at innocence when we know bloody well when we are guilt-ridden.  Time to wake up Maisie [ET]. Life is a waste without her.  2 October 1969 – Geneva  When we came out of the Musée des Beaux Arts the cab driver had vanished, but he returned a few minutes later having very sweetly bought a single rose for Elizabeth. Somewhere between [then] and dinner, brooding set in. Between long silences deadly insults were hurled. At one point E knowing I was in a state of nastiness said to me: “Come on Richard, hold my hand.” Me: “I do not wish to touch your hands. They are large and ugly and red and masculine.” Or words to that effect.  This morning E said that I really must get her the 69-carat ring to make her ugly big hands look smaller and less ugly! Nobody turns insults to her advantage more swiftly or more cleverly than Lady Elizabeth.  18 November 1969 – Monaco  This morning in the early hours the pot decided to have a go at the kettle and won handle down. E, the pot, gave this particular kettle, me, a savage mauling. I was coldly accused of virtually every sin under the sun. Drunkenness (true) mendacity (true) being boring (true) infidelity (untrue) killing myself fairly quickly (true) pride envy avarice (all true) being ugly (true) having once been handsome (untrue) and any other vice imaginable except homosexuality and ungenerousness.  29 March 1970 – Mexico  For E and I there is a kind of armistice. Both sides are fully armed, the bombs are ready to go off but so far nobody has pressed the button. The first six months of our sabbatical have been completely wasted. Except when we were alone we have bickered and quarrelled incessantly, and we have hardly ever been alone. Anyway back to work soon thank God.  3 July 1970 – location filming in Mexico  Drove into Mexicali yesterday, took a room for the day at the Lucerna Hotel, phoned Elizabeth. It was delicious talking to her. So for the first time in my life I appreciated the normally despised telephone. I talked to her twice in a couple of hours! She said she missed me as badly as I missed her and she mooned about at night and felt almost tearful over a pair of my socks that she saw hanging about.  9 February 1972 – Budapest   E and I did our going to bed exercises last night together. It is especially droll when we do running on the spot as she has to hold her breasts – one hand on each – for firm as they are, they are pretty big and the resultant wiggle-waggle is a pretty fetching sight and were it open to the public it would fetch in a lot of people. Like 10 million.  Burton’s diaries end in March 1972, and continue only in occasional fragments after 1975. In the intervening years, he and Taylor divorced. They remarried each other 16 months later, on 10 October 1975:  6 October 1975 – Johannesburg  E in splendid form. When she said we should get married in Chobe this week I thought she was joking. But she turned out to be serious. Result the latter half of the day a series of ½ joking ½ bitter invective from E. I told her that I was afraid! Literally afraid, at the moment, that marriage might horrifyingly end in divorce. We will of course get married again if E so wishes but until I get over my fear and since I am, at least, deliriously happy at the moment why spoil it!  7 October 1975 – Johannesburg – Chobe   Grass landing. Slight brush with grim reaper. Left suspension, left wheel packed it in. Guess that we were within 6–8–12 inches from kingdom come. Decided to get married here as soon as possible unless E (or I, for that matter) changes mind. Love her beyond measure and above anything. She fast asleep. Shiver, shiver, shake shake. Can’t wait for E to awaken!  10 October 1975  Got shamefully sloshed and despite all my idiocies – nasty too – we are as happy as children. We catch our breaths every so often and say with a kind of smiling wonder and delight “Hey! Do you realise we are actually married?” We must have said it scores of times. I have never been so happy in my life. E cured me with loving even lavish attention. This is far better marriage than the first despite its silly (and dangerous) beginning.  Burton and Taylor divorced for the second time less than a year after the wedding in Chobe. Their story resumes in 1983, when they are due to appear together in a Broadway production of Noël Coward’s ‘Private Lives’. By this time Burton is in a relationship with Sally Hay, who would become his last wife.   13 March 1983 – New York  Went to see ET who is using Rock Hudson’s flat. Little or no library. Horrid flat. E’s face OK but figure aplop! Also drinking. Also has not yet read the play! That’s my girl. Became very sentimental. “Please don’t marry Sally for my sake for a long time.” “I have no dates.” She is very lonely. Feel sorry for her. A mass of mess. Poor thing. “I have no dates” means “Nobody wants me for myself.” True too!  14 March 1983 [in rehearsal]  ET still drinking. Wine only she says. Couldn’t even read the lines properly. This is going to be a long long seven months. ET beginning to bore, which I would not have thought possible all those years ago. How terrible a thing time is.  15 March 1983  ET only 15 minutes late but then spent 15 minutes more doing her eyebrows. She stinks of garlic – who eats garlic for breakfast? She is also on something or another because there are lines here and there which she can’t say at all [underlined]. Very worrying. Tells me twice an hour how lonely she is.  20 March 1983   Went to ET’s for brunch. Eggs Benedict, chips, peas. All had Mimosas except me. Ran through second act with ET abysmal. She was quite crocked by this time and couldn’t even read the lines let alone remember them. She gave me the terrors again. She is such a mess.  21 March 1983  ET no better. Sally saw her have a Fernet Branca at 12.30pm then she drank white wine quite openly. Because she’s struggling for words it makes for a very long day.  22 March 1983  ET impossibly sloshed all day long. So much so she couldn’t even read [underlined] the lines. In hating and hateable mood – an iron mouse. God were we glad to get home.  Richard Burton’s diary entries end in early April 1983. In July he married Sally, and on August 5 1984 he died in his sleep of a brain haemorrhage, at the age of 58.  ‘The Richard Burton Diaries’, edited by Chris Williams, are published by Yale (£25) and available from Telegraph Bookshop.

 2 June 1965  Rose [at] 10 o’clock but weather dull. Had a good row with Burt [Elizabeth Taylor] and accused her, among other things, of lousy taste. She accused me among other things of snobbery. I said the only thing we had in common was Yahtsee. I forgot some other things.  20 March 1966  We had lunch with Vittorio De Sica and his wife and two children (boys). One boy played the guitar – what a horrible instrument, worse than a mouth-accordion, or a paper-and-comb. But De Sica really looked on his son with admiration. He had the face of a demented and somewhat stupefied fish. And so the day wore on inevitably to another regret in the lost and in the future to be recalled days. What shall we do now. B----- it then. Let’s row.  1 April 1966

Richard Burton Diaries: 'I behaved with disgrace'

17 Sep 2012



 What a day! I went in at about 11.30 to see the test of the new costume [for Franco Zeffirelli’s Taming of the Shrew]. It was alright – at least it was better than the other. At lunch I was so exasperated that I left the table snarling, “You’ll excuse me, I’m in a bad mood.” Shumdit [ET] said with her usual immense tact, “Really, Richard?” I snarled again something witty like “Shut your mouth” and went tramping furiously over our few acres with E’en So [their dog]. When I returned I kissed Shumdit better and then began to attack again. Then we kissed it all better again.  3 June 1966  I had only one shot to do this morning but, malheureusement, Eliz had three, then of course she had to wash her hair for the weekend so we got away from the studio at 1.30. Down to Corsetti’s for lunch – a delicious sole from the Adriatic and Eliz a sea-bass, all with french fries and washed down by two bottles of Fontana Candida – a nice white cold wine from Frascati. […] I was asleep by 9pm. Made myself some cabbage soup at 2am and was joined by Bon Apetito [ET]. We eat from the same bowl like two pups.  24 September 1966 – Italy  We are down at Tor Vaianica. She cooks, I clean – a little. She does hot dogs and hamburgers and omelettes and soup. I do salads and I clean – a little. Apart from people staring and the occasional autograph we are not much bothered. One fat young girl last weekend asked me to autograph her behind – only barely covered by a bikini. I declined and signed her arm instead.  3 November 1966   For some reason I worried a lot about E this morning, whether she loved me or not and how awful it would be to lose her etc. I worked myself up into a rare state of misery and was absurdly relieved when she telephoned from the studio.

Decided to get married here as soon as possible unless E (or I, for that matter) changes mind. Love her beyond measure and above anything. She fast asleep. Shiver, shiver, shake shake.

Because she’s struggling for words it makes for a very long day.  22 March 1983  ET impossibly sloshed all day long. So much so she couldn’t even read [underlined] the lines. In hating and hateable mood – an iron mouse. God were we glad to get home.  Richard Burton’s diary entries end in early April 1983. In July he married Sally, and on August 5 1984 he died in his sleep of a brain haemorrhage, at the age of 58.  ‘The Richard Burton Diaries’, edited by Chris Williams, are published by Yale (£25) and available from Telegraph Bookshop. 
 2 June 1965  Rose [at] 10 o’clock but weather dull. Had a good row with Burt [Elizabeth Taylor] and accused her, among other things, of lousy taste. She accused me among other things of snobbery. I said the only thing we had in common was Yahtsee. I forgot some other things.  20 March 1966  We had lunch with Vittorio De Sica and his wife and two children (boys). One boy played the guitar – what a horrible instrument, worse than a mouth-accordion, or a paper-and-comb. But De Sica really looked on his son with admiration. He had the face of a demented and somewhat stupefied fish. And so the day wore on inevitably to another regret in the lost and in the future to be recalled days. What shall we do now. B----- it then. Let’s row.  1 April 1966

Richard Burton Diaries: 'I behaved with disgrace'

17 Sep 2012


Related Articles What a day! I went in at about 11.30 to see the test of the new costume [for Franco Zeffirelli’s Taming of the Shrew]. It was alright – at least it was better than the other. At lunch I was so exasperated that I left the table snarling, “You’ll excuse me, I’m in a bad mood.” Shumdit [ET] said with her usual immense tact, “Really, Richard?” I snarled again something witty like “Shut your mouth” and went tramping furiously over our few acres with E’en So [their dog]. When I returned I kissed Shumdit better and then began to attack again. Then we kissed it all better again.  3 June 1966  I had only one shot to do this morning but, malheureusement, Eliz had three, then of course she had to wash her hair for the weekend so we got away from the studio at 1.30. Down to Corsetti’s for lunch – a delicious sole from the Adriatic and Eliz a sea-bass, all with french fries and washed down by two bottles of Fontana Candida – a nice white cold wine from Frascati. […] I was asleep by 9pm. Made myself some cabbage soup at 2am and was joined by Bon Apetito [ET]. We eat from the same bowl like two pups.  24 September 1966 – Italy  We are down at Tor Vaianica. She cooks, I clean – a little. She does hot dogs and hamburgers and omelettes and soup. I do salads and I clean – a little. Apart from people staring and the occasional autograph we are not much bothered. One fat young girl last weekend asked me to autograph her behind – only barely covered by a bikini. I declined and signed her arm instead.  3 November 1966   For some reason I worried a lot about E this morning, whether she loved me or not and how awful it would be to lose her etc. I worked myself up into a rare state of misery and was absurdly relieved when she telephoned from the studio. What’s the matter with me?  10 January 1967  I am madly “in love” with her at the moment, as distinct from always loving her, and want to make love to her every minute but alas it is not possible for a couple of days. She’ll have trouble walking in a couple or three days.  24 May 1967 – Portofino  E anxious I write about her [in the diary] so here goes: She is a nice fat girl who loves mosquitoes and hates pustular carbuncular Welshmen, loathes boats and loves planes, has tiny blackcurrant eyes and minute breasts and has no sense of humour. She is prudish, priggish and painfully self-conscious.  30 July 1967 – Taormina  A slow day, marking time, with a walk in which we bought sunglasses at a little shop. As we left the crowd which had gathered applauded us. E thought it very sweet, which indeed it was. We dined in somnolence and some self-satisfaction as we compared our ancestors and former wives and husbands.  E has become very slim and I can barely keep my hands off her. It turns out that she’s not that less in weight but, as a result of massage and exercise the weight has been redistributed. She is at the moment among the most dishiest girls I’ve ever seen. The most. I mean dishiest.  30 September 1967 – Paris – Capo Caccia  At 12 noon I did something beyond outrage. I bought Elizabeth the jet plane we flew in yesterday. It costs, brand new, $960,000. She was not displeased.  26 September 1968 – Paris  We worked from seven last night to approx four this morning. […] Elizabeth has gone off to work and “test” costumes. She should be back before I leave I hope. After seven or is it eight years I still miss her if she goes to the bathroom.  8 November 1968  After completing yesterday’s entry with milady fast asleep in bed as I thought, I was looking through some scenes in the script when suddenly the bedroom door opened and standing there in a near diaphanous nightgown with one shoulder slipped on to her arm was E. So I went back to bed for 10 minutes. I was unquestionably seduced and I teased her about it for the rest of the day when we talked on the telephone. She was very beautiful. It is a fact that after all these years the girl can still blush. I lost that latter capacity a long long time ago.  10 November 1968  I am now 43. It’s nine in the morning. The sky is grey but it has a look of turning into sunshine later on. Yesterday was wholly delightful. We drank vodka screwdrivers, but not too many. E and I played gin rummy for $1,000 a point. I won $648,000! I refused to accept a cheque. It has to be paid in kind, I said.  19 November 1968 – Paris   Famed as we are, rich as we are, courted and insulted as we are, overpaid as we are, centre of a great deal of attention as we are, [we] are not bored or blasé. We are not envious. We are merely lucky.  I have been inordinately lucky all my life but the greatest luck of all has been Elizabeth. She has turned me into a moral man but not a prig, she is a wildly exciting lover-mistress, she is shy and witty, she is nobody’s fool, she is a brilliant actress, she is beautiful beyond the dreams of pornography, she can be arrogant and wilful, she is clement and loving, Dulcis Imperatrix, she is Sunday’s child, she can tolerate my impossibilities and my drunkenness, she is an ache in the stomach when I am away from her, and she loves me!  22 December 1968 – Gstaad  We arrived yesterday in furious fettle. I was in one of my absolutely unstoppably filthy moods, insulting everybody right left and centre. Elizabeth screamed a bit. I accused her of being a hypochondriac, that she was only ill when she chose to be. How odd, I said, that when you were in Paris and had to work you were unable to move, but once here in Gstaad you’re gambolling around like a spring lamb etc etc. And I couldn’t keep away from the subject. It’s like a bloke who nearly kills a child in his car and then smacks it for frightening him. I shout at E out of fear for her health. I rarely think of anything else.  29 March 1969 – Puerto Vallarta  Elizabeth is now looking ravishingly sun-tanned though the lazy little b------ ought to lose a few pounds to look at her absolute best. Looking as critically as I can I detect no sign of ageing in her at all except that she has quite a few grey hairs. Her skin is as smooth and as youthful and unwrinkled as it ever was. The breasts, despite their largeness and considerable weight, sag very slightly but no more than they did 10 years ago. Her bottom is firm and round. She needs weight off her stomach, but she swam quite a lot yesterday and if she keeps that up she should be quite firm by the time we get back to London. Dreadful thought, London.  4 April 1969  Yesterday was a funny day. It went splendidly for the first half and degenerated into bickering around 3.30 in the pm. It was largely my fault. E of course was no help at all and bickered back with almost masculine pride. This was some of the dialogue, roughly speaking:  Me: (having gone to read upstairs in the bedroom about 8pm) “Is the bathroom still smelling?”  She: “Yes.”  Me: “I can’t smell anything in there. Perhaps it’s you.”  She: “F--- off.” (She leaves bedroom and goes downstairs while me remains reading on bed.)  She: (having come back upstairs 20 minutes or so later standing at the doorway with a look of real loathing on her face) “I dislike you and hate you.”  Me: (getting into dressing gown) “Goodnight, have a good sleep.”  She: “You too.”  NB: For the benefit of [readers of] this little study of home life among the Burtons, it must be emphasised that though the words used are innocuous, the speaking of them is instinct with venomous malice.  25 May 1969  What an extraordinary world it is. How do you live with one person for 13 years, and another for eight and find both as alien as strangers. Elizabeth is an eternal one night stand. She is my private and personal bought mistress. And lascivious with it. It is impossible to tell you what is consisted in the act of love. Well I’ll tell you, E is a receiver, a perpetual returner of the ball! I don’t write about sex very often, because it embarrasses me, but, but…  6 August 1969  E said this morning that I lacked loyalty. Now she is a bright b----- to talk about loyalty. The list of her dis‑loyalties would fill the yellow pages of the New York Telephone Directory. Except of course to her children. And there she defeats me because I've been disloyal to mine.  31 August 1969 – Sunday morning  Yesterday was another terrible day. I behaved in a way to make a banshee look kind good and sweet. Insulting Elizabeth, drunk, periodically excusing myself rather shabbily and then starting the rough treatment all over again. Sometimes I am so much my father’s son that I give myself occasional creeps. He had the same gift for damaging with the tongue, he had the same temporary violence, he had the same fidelity to mam that I have to Elizabeth, he had the same smattering of scholarship, he had the same didactitism (bet I spelled that wrong), we wave the same admonitory finger at innocence when we know bloody well when we are guilt-ridden.  Time to wake up Maisie [ET]. Life is a waste without her.  2 October 1969 – Geneva  When we came out of the Musée des Beaux Arts the cab driver had vanished, but he returned a few minutes later having very sweetly bought a single rose for Elizabeth. Somewhere between [then] and dinner, brooding set in. Between long silences deadly insults were hurled. At one point E knowing I was in a state of nastiness said to me: “Come on Richard, hold my hand.” Me: “I do not wish to touch your hands. They are large and ugly and red and masculine.” Or words to that effect.  This morning E said that I really must get her the 69-carat ring to make her ugly big hands look smaller and less ugly! Nobody turns insults to her advantage more swiftly or more cleverly than Lady Elizabeth.  18 November 1969 – Monaco  This morning in the early hours the pot decided to have a go at the kettle and won handle down. E, the pot, gave this particular kettle, me, a savage mauling. I was coldly accused of virtually every sin under the sun. Drunkenness (true) mendacity (true) being boring (true) infidelity (untrue) killing myself fairly quickly (true) pride envy avarice (all true) being ugly (true) having once been handsome (untrue) and any other vice imaginable except homosexuality and ungenerousness.  29 March 1970 – Mexico  For E and I there is a kind of armistice. Both sides are fully armed, the bombs are ready to go off but so far nobody has pressed the button. The first six months of our sabbatical have been completely wasted. Except when we were alone we have bickered and quarrelled incessantly, and we have hardly ever been alone. Anyway back to work soon thank God.  3 July 1970 – location filming in Mexico  Drove into Mexicali yesterday, took a room for the day at the Lucerna Hotel, phoned Elizabeth. It was delicious talking to her. So for the first time in my life I appreciated the normally despised telephone. I talked to her twice in a couple of hours! She said she missed me as badly as I missed her and she mooned about at night and felt almost tearful over a pair of my socks that she saw hanging about.  9 February 1972 – Budapest   E and I did our going to bed exercises last night together. It is especially droll when we do running on the spot as she has to hold her breasts – one hand on each – for firm as they are, they are pretty big and the resultant wiggle-waggle is a pretty fetching sight and were it open to the public it would fetch in a lot of people. Like 10 million.  Burton’s diaries end in March 1972, and continue only in occasional fragments after 1975. In the intervening years, he and Taylor divorced. They remarried each other 16 months later, on 10 October 1975:  6 October 1975 – Johannesburg  E in splendid form. When she said we should get married in Chobe this week I thought she was joking. But she turned out to be serious. Result the latter half of the day a series of ½ joking ½ bitter invective from E. I told her that I was afraid! Literally afraid, at the moment, that marriage might horrifyingly end in divorce. We will of course get married again if E so wishes but until I get over my fear and since I am, at least, deliriously happy at the moment why spoil it!  7 October 1975 – Johannesburg – Chobe   Grass landing. Slight brush with grim reaper. Left suspension, left wheel packed it in. Guess that we were within 6–8–12 inches from kingdom come. Decided to get married here as soon as possible unless E (or I, for that matter) changes mind. Love her beyond measure and above anything. She fast asleep. Shiver, shiver, shake shake. Can’t wait for E to awaken!  10 October 1975  Got shamefully sloshed and despite all my idiocies – nasty too – we are as happy as children. We catch our breaths every so often and say with a kind of smiling wonder and delight “Hey! Do you realise we are actually married?” We must have said it scores of times. I have never been so happy in my life. E cured me with loving even lavish attention. This is far better marriage than the first despite its silly (and dangerous) beginning.  Burton and Taylor divorced for the second time less than a year after the wedding in Chobe. Their story resumes in 1983, when they are due to appear together in a Broadway production of Noël Coward’s ‘Private Lives’. By this time Burton is in a relationship with Sally Hay, who would become his last wife.   13 March 1983 – New York  Went to see ET who is using Rock Hudson’s flat. Little or no library. Horrid flat. E’s face OK but figure aplop! Also drinking. Also has not yet read the play! That’s my girl. Became very sentimental. “Please don’t marry Sally for my sake for a long time.” “I have no dates.” She is very lonely. Feel sorry for her. A mass of mess. Poor thing. “I have no dates” means “Nobody wants me for myself.” True too!  14 March 1983 [in rehearsal]  ET still drinking. Wine only she says. Couldn’t even read the lines properly. This is going to be a long long seven months. ET beginning to bore, which I would not have thought possible all those years ago. How terrible a thing time is.  15 March 1983  ET only 15 minutes late but then spent 15 minutes more doing her eyebrows. She stinks of garlic – who eats garlic for breakfast? She is also on something or another because there are lines here and there which she can’t say at all [underlined]. Very worrying. Tells me twice an hour how lonely she is.  20 March 1983   Went to ET’s for brunch. Eggs Benedict, chips, peas. All had Mimosas except me. Ran through second act with ET abysmal. She was quite crocked by this time and couldn’t even read the lines let alone remember them. She gave me the terrors again. She is such a mess.  21 March 1983  ET no better. Sally saw her have a Fernet Branca at 12.30pm then she drank white wine quite openly. Because she’s struggling for words it makes for a very long day.  22 March 1983  ET impossibly sloshed all day long. So much so she couldn’t even read [underlined] the lines. In hating and hateable mood – an iron mouse. God were we glad to get home.  Richard Burton’s diary entries end in early April 1983.
