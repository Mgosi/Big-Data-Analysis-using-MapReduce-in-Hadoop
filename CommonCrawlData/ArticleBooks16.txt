For more than a hundred years the name Count Dracula has struck a chill into the hearts of readers. The original Bram Stoker novel has spawned countless imitation stories and a rich tradition of vampire films that still thrill audiences today.Now, in the centenary year of the author's death, a discovery of lost work by him has shed fresh light on a great horror masterpiece. An American author has unearthed writings by the Irish novelist that were published more than a century ago in periodicals that have long since disappeared, some of which give new insights into his 1897 story of the bloodsucking count.Following two years of archival detective work, John Edgar Browning, a specialist in horror and fantasy, has tracked down short stories, poetry and journalism. The Forgotten Writings of Bram Stoker is published this month by Palgrave Macmillan. Browning told the Observer of his astonishment at finding "an entire book's worth" of published material that "no one living today knew about". The writings reveal much about the style and background Stoker would re-use in his classic vampire story.Browning said of the new texts: "These stories offer some of the proto-primordial writings and ideas from [which] Dracula would be fashioned. Much of what we love about Stoker's vampire novel … had to be experimented with first, and in these writings Stoker does just that." The discoveries include Old Hoggen: A Mystery, a Gothic comedy from 1893 – four years before Dracula. Its protagonist, Augustus, is searching for crabs along the English coast one morning when he spots a drowned corpse floating – that of a disreputable character, Old Hoggen. He drags the body onto the beach and relieves it of valuables he finds, but it is so decayed body parts start falling off. Finally, he is left only with the head to carry under his arm. When two crabs emerge from the chest cavity, he puts them into his "shooting jacket" for his family.In 1882 Stoker jumped into the Thames in an attempt to save a drowning suicide victim. He carried the body to his home, hoping in vain that his brother, a surgeon, might revive him.Old Hoggen bears a striking parallel between the corpse and Count Dracula, whose coats were each stuffed with a fortune in bank notes. One passage reads: "Old Hoggen's] coat became torn, revealing a mass of bank notes between cloth and lining."An 1894 love story, When the Sky Rains Gold, reveals Stoker's love of maps, also reflected in Dracula, and an American frontiersman brandishing a Bowie knife – like Quincey Morris in his famous work.In Dracula we read: "[Jonathan Harker] had ready his great Kukri knife, and made a fierce and sudden cut at [Dracula]. The blow was a powerful one … The point just cut the cloth of his coat, making a wide gap whence a bundle of bank-notes and a stream of gold fell out."There is another parallel. Old Hoggen's female character exudes love and purity and has a mouth "like pearl and ruby where the white teeth shone through the parted lips". Those words echo in Dracula – the count's vampire "sisters" have "brilliant white teeth that shone like pearls against the ruby of their voluptuous lips".Browning said: "Stoker was busy researching Dracula at the time he published this story … The once clear demarcation in Dracula between heroine and villainess is made uncomfortably fluid by Stoker's parallel descriptions in these love stories."Other "forgotten" material includes The Wrongs of Grosvenor Square, a political poem whose text reflects an exploration of dialects that he was to develop with his Yorkshire dialect in Dracula.Abraham Stoker (1847-1912) began his writing career as a drama critic for an evening paper, through which he befriended the famed actor Sir Henry Irving, becoming for 27 years his manager. One of the poems is dedicated to him. Stoker began work on Dracula in 1890, stumbling across the name "Dracula" in a library.

For more than a hundred years the name Count Dracula has struck a chill into the hearts of readers. The original Bram Stoker novel has spawned countless imitation stories and a rich tradition of vampire films that still thrill audiences today.
Now, in the centenary year of the author's death, a discovery of lost work by him has shed fresh light on a great horror masterpiece. An American author has unearthed writings by the Irish novelist that were published more than a century ago in periodicals that have long since disappeared, some of which give new insights into his 1897 story of the bloodsucking count.
Following two years of archival detective work, John Edgar Browning, a specialist in horror and fantasy, has tracked down short stories, poetry and journalism. The Forgotten Writings of Bram Stoker is published this month by Palgrave Macmillan. Browning told the Observer of his astonishment at finding "an entire book's worth" of published material that "no one living today knew about". The writings reveal much about the style and background Stoker would re-use in his classic vampire story.
Browning said of the new texts: "These stories offer some of the proto-primordial writings and ideas from [which] Dracula would be fashioned. Much of what we love about Stoker's vampire novel … had to be experimented with first, and in these writings Stoker does just that." The discoveries include Old Hoggen: A Mystery, a Gothic comedy from 1893 – four years before Dracula. Its protagonist, Augustus, is searching for crabs along the English coast one morning when he spots a drowned corpse floating – that of a disreputable character, Old Hoggen. He drags the body onto the beach and relieves it of valuables he finds, but it is so decayed body parts start falling off. Finally, he is left only with the head to carry under his arm. When two crabs emerge from the chest cavity, he puts them into his "shooting jacket" for his family.
In 1882 Stoker jumped into the Thames in an attempt to save a drowning suicide victim. He carried the body to his home, hoping in vain that his brother, a surgeon, might revive him.
Old Hoggen bears a striking parallel between the corpse and Count Dracula, whose coats were each stuffed with a fortune in bank notes. One passage reads: "Old Hoggen's] coat became torn, revealing a mass of bank notes between cloth and lining."
An 1894 love story, When the Sky Rains Gold, reveals Stoker's love of maps, also reflected in Dracula, and an American frontiersman brandishing a Bowie knife – like Quincey Morris in his famous work.
In Dracula we read: "[Jonathan Harker] had ready his great Kukri knife, and made a fierce and sudden cut at [Dracula]. The blow was a powerful one … The point just cut the cloth of his coat, making a wide gap whence a bundle of bank-notes and a stream of gold fell out."
There is another parallel. Old Hoggen's female character exudes love and purity and has a mouth "like pearl and ruby where the white teeth shone through the parted lips". Those words echo in Dracula – the count's vampire "sisters" have "brilliant white teeth that shone like pearls against the ruby of their voluptuous lips".
Browning said: "Stoker was busy researching Dracula at the time he published this story … The once clear demarcation in Dracula between heroine and villainess is made uncomfortably fluid by Stoker's parallel descriptions in these love stories."
Other "forgotten" material includes The Wrongs of Grosvenor Square, a political poem whose text reflects an exploration of dialects that he was to develop with his Yorkshire dialect in Dracula.
Abraham Stoker (1847-1912) began his writing career as a drama critic for an evening paper, through which he befriended the famed actor Sir Henry Irving, becoming for 27 years his manager. One of the poems is dedicated to him. Stoker began work on Dracula in 1890, stumbling across the name "Dracula" in a library.

For more than a hundred years the name Count Dracula has struck a chill into the hearts of readers. The original Bram Stoker novel has spawned countless imitation stories and a rich tradition of vampire films that still thrill audiences today.
Now, in the centenary year of the author's death, a discovery of lost work by him has shed fresh light on a great horror masterpiece. An American author has unearthed writings by the Irish novelist that were published more than a century ago in periodicals that have long since disappeared, some of which give new insights into his 1897 story of the bloodsucking count.
Following two years of archival detective work, John Edgar Browning, a specialist in horror and fantasy, has tracked down short stories, poetry and journalism. The Forgotten Writings of Bram Stoker is published this month by Palgrave Macmillan. Browning told the Observer of his astonishment at finding "an entire book's worth" of published material that "no one living today knew about". The writings reveal much about the style and background Stoker would re-use in his classic vampire story.

Much of what we love about Stoker's vampire novel … had to be experimented with first, and in these writings Stoker does just that." The discoveries include Old Hoggen: A Mystery, a Gothic comedy from 1893 – four years before Dracula. Its protagonist, Augustus, is searching for crabs along the English coast one morning when he spots a drowned corpse floating – that of a disreputable character, Old Hoggen. He drags the body onto the beach and relieves it of valuables he finds, but it is so decayed body parts start falling off. Finally, he is left only with the head to carry under his arm. When two crabs emerge from the chest cavity, he puts them into his "shooting jacket" for his family.
In 1882 Stoker jumped into the Thames in an attempt to save a drowning suicide victim. He carried the body to his home, hoping in vain that his brother, a surgeon, might revive him.
Old Hoggen bears a striking parallel between the corpse and Count Dracula, whose coats were each stuffed with a fortune in bank notes. One passage reads: "Old Hoggen's] coat became torn, revealing a mass of bank notes between cloth and lining."

Browning said of the new texts: "These stories offer some of the proto-primordial writings and ideas from [which] Dracula would be fashioned. Much of what we love about Stoker's vampire novel … had to be experimented with first, and in these writings Stoker does just that." The discoveries include Old Hoggen: A Mystery, a Gothic comedy from 1893 – four years before Dracula. Its protagonist, Augustus, is searching for crabs along the English coast one morning when he spots a drowned corpse floating – that of a disreputable character, Old Hoggen. He drags the body onto the beach and relieves it of valuables he finds, but it is so decayed body parts start falling off. Finally, he is left only with the head to carry under his arm. When two crabs emerge from the chest cavity, he puts them into his "shooting jacket" for his family.
In 1882 Stoker jumped into the Thames in an attempt to save a drowning suicide victim. He carried the body to his home, hoping in vain that his brother, a surgeon, might revive him.
Old Hoggen bears a striking parallel between the corpse and Count Dracula, whose coats were each stuffed with a fortune in bank notes. One passage reads: "Old Hoggen's] coat became torn, revealing a mass of bank notes between cloth and lining."
An 1894 love story, When the Sky Rains Gold, reveals Stoker's love of maps, also reflected in Dracula, and an American frontiersman brandishing a Bowie knife – like Quincey Morris in his famous work.
In Dracula we read: "[Jonathan Harker] had ready his great Kukri knife, and made a fierce and sudden cut at [Dracula]. The blow was a powerful one … The point just cut the cloth of his coat, making a wide gap whence a bundle of bank-notes and a stream of gold fell out."
There is another parallel. Old Hoggen's female character exudes love and purity and has a mouth "like pearl and ruby where the white teeth shone through the parted lips". Those words echo in Dracula – the count's vampire "sisters" have "brilliant white teeth that shone like pearls against the ruby of their voluptuous lips".
Browning said: "Stoker was busy researching Dracula at the time he published this story … The once clear demarcation in Dracula between heroine and villainess is made uncomfortably fluid by Stoker's parallel descriptions in these love stories."
Other "forgotten" material includes The Wrongs of Grosvenor Square, a political poem whose text reflects an exploration of dialects that he was to develop with his Yorkshire dialect in Dracula.
Abraham Stoker (1847-1912) began his writing career as a drama critic for an evening paper, through which he befriended the famed actor Sir Henry Irving, becoming for 27 years his manager. One of the poems is dedicated to him. Stoker began work on Dracula in 1890, stumbling across the name "Dracula" in a library.

For more than a hundred years the name Count Dracula has struck a chill into the hearts of readers. The original Bram Stoker novel has spawned countless imitation stories and a rich tradition of vampire films that still thrill audiences today.
Now, in the centenary year of the author's death, a discovery of lost work by him has shed fresh light on a great horror masterpiece. An American author has unearthed writings by the Irish novelist that were published more than a century ago in periodicals that have long since disappeared, some of which give new insights into his 1897 story of the bloodsucking count.
Following two years of archival detective work, John Edgar Browning, a specialist in horror and fantasy, has tracked down short stories, poetry and journalism. The Forgotten Writings of Bram Stoker is published this month by Palgrave Macmillan. Browning told the Observer of his astonishment at finding "an entire book's worth" of published material that "no one living today knew about". The writings reveal much about the style and background Stoker would re-use in his classic vampire story.
