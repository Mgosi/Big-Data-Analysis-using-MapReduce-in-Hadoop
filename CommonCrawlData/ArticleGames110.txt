Blimey! Games Limited, the games software developer on 8 January
2009. This follows the insolvency of Blimey!s German parent
company, 10tacle Studios AG in the summer of 2008.David Rubin and Asher Miller of London firm, David Rubin &
Partners, were appointed to save the business as a going concern
when it became apparent that Blimey! was insolvent and
couldnt survive on its own  after the demise of
10tacle and the knock on effect it had on those funding some of
Blimey!s projects.We kept things going as long as possible commented
Ian Bell, the former director of Blimey!, because of the
amazing work the team was doing on our one surviving project and
the patience of our publisher. However it was commercially
unsustainable and it soon became clear that unless decisive action
was taken we would lose that. A sale of the business and
assets was therefore agreed by the Administrators with Slightly Mad
Studios Limited, a company established by Ian Bell.The successful sale will also result in creditors of Blimey!
hopefully receiving most if not all of the money they are owed and
will preserve the jobs of all Blimey!s workforce.Commenting on the sale, Joint Administrator David Rubin said,
I am delighted that we have managed to preserve such a
fantastic team. To be able to save these jobs and skills when we
see so much gloom elsewhere in the labour market is a real
testament to the Rescue Culture that my profession and our firm
strive to support.Mr Rubin went on to say that Directors who face up
quickly to the challenges posed by the current economic climate
stand a better prospect of a rescue procedure working. Mr Ian Bell,
the director of Blimey! moved quickly to take appropriate advice
from his solicitors Sheridans who involved us at a very early
stage. That prompt action was key to finding a solution to the
company's problems.Ian Bell went on to say, This sale has ended months of
uncertainty and worry for all concerned. We can now look forward to
the development of our exciting existing and future
projects.For more information:David RubinDavid Rubin & Partners0208 343 5900Alex ChapmanSheridans Solicitors 0207 079 0100Slightly Mad Studios Ltd0207 252 1843
