Ariana Grande hit the road for the first stop in her Sweetener World Tour on Monday (March 18) and the pre-show setlist featured a sweet nod to the late Mac Miller.As the arena filled eager fans, eagle-eared Arianators took notice that one of the songs playing in the house was Mac Miller’s 2016 collaboration with Anderson .Paak “Dang!” The track served as the lead single on the late rapper’s fourth studio album, The Divine Feminine, which also featured a duet between Mac and then-girlfriend Ariana titled “My Favorite Part.”The two stars dated for nearly two years before breaking up last May, just four months before Miller’s tragic overdose in September 2018. In the wake of the rapper's death, Ariana split from fiancé Pete Davidson and subsequently released her record-breaking LP, Thank U, Next.
