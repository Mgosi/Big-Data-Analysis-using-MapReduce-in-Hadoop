By Cody DelistratyNovember 20, 2016In Michael Chabon’s new book, “Moonglow,” about the lasting effects of the Second World War, it is difficult to discern what is autobiographical and what is not.When Michael Chabon was eleven years old, he decided that the world was a broken place. “When my parents separated and divorced, it completely upended everything that I thought I knew,” Chabon said recently, on the phone from his home, in Berkeley, California. “After that happened, not only did I see that my world was broken but, in fact, that brokenness was everywhere in one way or another. It really affected my way of seeing everything thereafter.”It also prompted him to find refuge in made-up places. “Scale models try to approximate a whole world, a world that doesn’t have a crack,” Chabon explained, mentioning Wes Anderson’s meticulously constructed cinematic worlds. “But, of course, the more accurate your scale model is, the more likely it is to show the cracks. The element of creating scale models, which is pretty grounded in ‘Moonglow,’ is present in nearly all of my books.”“Moonglow,” which comes out this week, is Chabon’s “first faux-memoir novel,” as he put it. The book takes place in 1989. The narrator’s grandfather is on his deathbed, and, with his inhibitions loosed by pain medication, he begins to recount his life’s adventures, from his childhood in Philadelphia to his experience as a soldier during the invasion of Germany, his career at NASA in Cape Canaveral, his imprisonment in New York, his wife’s commitment to an insane asylum, and, finally, their old age in Florida and in Oakland, where he lies dying, speaking with his grandson. In the chronicle of this grandly lived life, shot through with digressions on war and love and ruminations on literature and rocketry, Chabon renders an entire era within a single deathbed confession—a scale model of life after the Second World War.It is difficult to discern what is autobiographical and what is not in “Moonglow.” The narrator is named Michael Chabon, who would seem to be the author. Michael’s maternal grandfather, likewise, would seem to be Chabon’s maternal grandfather. In the novel’s preface, Chabon writes, “I have stuck to facts except where facts refused to conform with memory, narrative purpose, or the truth as I prefer to understand it.”Chabon said that if he approached the story as memoir, he never could have given that life the necessary narrative cohesion. “Besides, a memoir would’ve been so boring; there’s nothing to write,” he said. “That’s the problem with life.” So he wrapped what was true in a “a pack of lies.”The other thing Chabon used to hold the story together is a rollicking voice recalling “The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay,” his best-selling novel from 2000, which won the Pulitzer Prize. Adam Kirsch, in a review of “Moonglow” for Tablet, described Chabon’s books as “graphic novels in prose, in which hypervivid metaphors do the work of line and color.” Chabon, Kirsch argues, “uses stylization and exaggeration to create the large emotional effects his story requires.”Chabon doesn’t see it that way. “I think I am writing absolute, strict, exact descriptions of how the world is, whatever that world might happen to be,” he said. “So the fact that it comes off as vivid and gaudy, hyper-exaggerated, with graphic-book-novel-like prose, it’s always a little surprising to me. That’s just how I see things. But Vincent van Gogh thought he was a realist, too.”In any case, Chabon doesn’t see it as his role to assist in interpreting his work. “First, I’m trying to imagine the story, which is often a combination of research and experience and just pure—I don’t know what—chutzpah. Having imagined it, and getting down what I see—the eyes and the ears of my characters—that’s an absorbing task, and it’s so demanding.” He trailed off. “I’ll be honest: I just get interested in the story and start trying to tell it as well as I can. I just wrote the book; I don’t have to interpret it, too.”“Moonglow” is rich with possible interpretations. It is an intellectual, quasi-academic text filled with digressions on “Gravity’s Rainbow” and V-2 rockets delivered in a hallucinatory haste—and then, beneath the allusions, it is a love story about the narrator’s grandparents, who could never entirely be free of the terrors they witnessed. At its heart, the book is about the reverberating effects of the Second World War.For Chabon, the Second World War has set the tone for nothing less than the entire contemporary world. “Everything is traceable back to the Second World War,” he said. “That’s true not just of politics and the nations that are in contention in various ways around the world. It’s also true socially and in the ways that we all have grown up and have been schooled to look at the world. And, culturally, in terms of stories that have predominated, so many of them are ultimately rooted in some way or another in the Second World War, whether that’s James Bond or Marvel comics or 'Star Trek.' You can see the influence of those six years of conflict just absolutely everywhere.”In taking on the lasting effects of the Second World War, Chabon has treaded into twenty-first-century political history as well. But he’s not sure whether his novel could be applied to the current moment, when many of his readers are grappling with the consequences of President-elect Donald Trump. “I’m a backwards-looking person; I’m a ruminator; I’m very good at figuring out what happened a while back, but not so great at guessing what is going to happen,” he said. Still, “Moonglow” is another scale model of love and death and catastrophe. It’s another reminder that we live in a broken world. And fiction, Chabon said, “is an attempt to mend it.”Cody Delistraty is a writer and researcher based in Paris.Dive into the world of literature with The New Yorker’s weekly fiction newsletter.By Ben TaubBy Mike SpiesBy Susan B.

It really affected my way of seeing everything thereafter.”It also prompted him to find refuge in made-up places. “Scale models try to approximate a whole world, a world that doesn’t have a crack,” Chabon explained, mentioning Wes Anderson’s meticulously constructed cinematic worlds. “But, of course, the more accurate your scale model is, the more likely it is to show the cracks. The element of creating scale models, which is pretty grounded in ‘Moonglow,’ is present in nearly all of my books.”“Moonglow,” which comes out this week, is Chabon’s “first faux-memoir novel,” as he put it. The book takes place in 1989. The narrator’s grandfather is on his deathbed, and, with his inhibitions loosed by pain medication, he begins to recount his life’s adventures, from his childhood in Philadelphia to his experience as a soldier during the invasion of Germany, his career at NASA in Cape Canaveral, his imprisonment in New York, his wife’s commitment to an insane asylum, and, finally, their old age in Florida and in Oakland, where he lies dying, speaking with his grandson. In the chronicle of this grandly lived life, shot through with digressions on war and love and ruminations on literature and rocketry, Chabon renders an entire era within a single deathbed confession—a scale model of life after the Second World War.It is difficult to discern what is autobiographical and what is not in “Moonglow.” The narrator is named Michael Chabon, who would seem to be the author. Michael’s maternal grandfather, likewise, would seem to be Chabon’s maternal grandfather. In the novel’s preface, Chabon writes, “I have stuck to facts except where facts refused to conform with memory, narrative purpose, or the truth as I prefer to understand it.”Chabon said that if he approached the story as memoir, he never could have given that life the necessary narrative cohesion. “Besides, a memoir would’ve been so boring; there’s nothing to write,” he said. “That’s the problem with life.” So he wrapped what was true in a “a pack of lies.”The other thing Chabon used to hold the story together is a rollicking voice recalling “The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay,” his best-selling novel from 2000, which won the Pulitzer Prize. Adam Kirsch, in a review of “Moonglow” for Tablet, described Chabon’s books as “graphic novels in prose, in which hypervivid metaphors do the work of line and color.” Chabon, Kirsch argues, “uses stylization and exaggeration to create the large emotional effects his story requires.”Chabon doesn’t see it that way. “I think I am writing absolute, strict, exact descriptions of how the world is, whatever that world might happen to be,” he said. “So the fact that it comes off as vivid and gaudy, hyper-exaggerated, with graphic-book-novel-like prose, it’s always a little surprising to me. That’s just how I see things. But Vincent van Gogh thought he was a realist, too.”In any case, Chabon doesn’t see it as his role to assist in interpreting his work. “First, I’m trying to imagine the story, which is often a combination of research and experience and just pure—I don’t know what—chutzpah. Having imagined it, and getting down what I see—the eyes and the ears of my characters—that’s an absorbing task, and it’s so demanding.” He trailed off. “I’ll be honest: I just get interested in the story and start trying to tell it as well as I can. I just wrote the book; I don’t have to interpret it, too.”“Moonglow” is rich with possible interpretations. It is an intellectual, quasi-academic text filled with digressions on “Gravity’s Rainbow” and V-2 rockets delivered in a hallucinatory haste—and then, beneath the allusions, it is a love story about the narrator’s grandparents, who could never entirely be free of the terrors they witnessed. At its heart, the book is about the reverberating effects of the Second World War.For Chabon, the Second World War has set the tone for nothing less than the entire contemporary world. “Everything is traceable back to the Second World War,” he said. “That’s true not just of politics and the nations that are in contention in various ways around the world. It’s also true socially and in the ways that we all have grown up and have been schooled to look at the world. And, culturally, in terms of stories that have predominated, so many of them are ultimately rooted in some way or another in the Second World War, whether that’s James Bond or Marvel comics or 'Star Trek.' You can see the influence of those six years of conflict just absolutely everywhere.”In taking on the lasting effects of the Second World War, Chabon has treaded into twenty-first-century political history as well. But he’s not sure whether his novel could be applied to the current moment, when many of his readers are grappling with the consequences of President-elect Donald Trump. “I’m a backwards-looking person; I’m a ruminator; I’m very good at figuring out what happened a while back, but not so great at guessing what is going to happen,” he said. Still, “Moonglow” is another scale model of love and death and catastrophe. It’s another reminder that we live in a broken world. And fiction, Chabon said, “is an attempt to mend it.”Cody Delistraty is a writer and researcher based in Paris.Read more »More:BooksMichael ChabonThe Second World WarWritersDive into the world of literature with The New Yorker’s weekly fiction newsletter.SubmitMost Popular1.A Reporter at LargeGuantánamo’s Darkest SecretBy Ben Taub2.News DeskSecrecy, Self-Dealing, and Greed at the N.R.A.By Mike Spies3.Letter from Trump’s WashingtonThe Mueller Report Won’t End Trump’s Presidency, But It Sure Makes Him Look BadBy Susan B.

In the novel’s preface, Chabon writes, “I have stuck to facts except where facts refused to conform with memory, narrative purpose, or the truth as I prefer to understand it.”Chabon said that if he approached the story as memoir, he never could have given that life the necessary narrative cohesion. “Besides, a memoir would’ve been so boring; there’s nothing to write,” he said. “That’s the problem with life.” So he wrapped what was true in a “a pack of lies.”The other thing Chabon used to hold the story together is a rollicking voice recalling “The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay,” his best-selling novel from 2000, which won the Pulitzer Prize. Adam Kirsch, in a review of “Moonglow” for Tablet, described Chabon’s books as “graphic novels in prose, in which hypervivid metaphors do the work of line and color.” Chabon, Kirsch argues, “uses stylization and exaggeration to create the large emotional effects his story requires.”Chabon doesn’t see it that way. “I think I am writing absolute, strict, exact descriptions of how the world is, whatever that world might happen to be,” he said. “So the fact that it comes off as vivid and gaudy, hyper-exaggerated, with graphic-book-novel-like prose, it’s always a little surprising to me. That’s just how I see things. But Vincent van Gogh thought he was a realist, too.”In any case, Chabon doesn’t see it as his role to assist in interpreting his work. “First, I’m trying to imagine the story, which is often a combination of research and experience and just pure—I don’t know what—chutzpah. Having imagined it, and getting down what I see—the eyes and the ears of my characters—that’s an absorbing task, and it’s so demanding.” He trailed off. “I’ll be honest: I just get interested in the story and start trying to tell it as well as I can. I just wrote the book; I don’t have to interpret it, too.”“Moonglow” is rich with possible interpretations. It is an intellectual, quasi-academic text filled with digressions on “Gravity’s Rainbow” and V-2 rockets delivered in a hallucinatory haste—and then, beneath the allusions, it is a love story about the narrator’s grandparents, who could never entirely be free of the terrors they witnessed. At its heart, the book is about the reverberating effects of the Second World War.For Chabon, the Second World War has set the tone for nothing less than the entire contemporary world. “Everything is traceable back to the Second World War,” he said. “That’s true not just of politics and the nations that are in contention in various ways around the world. It’s also true socially and in the ways that we all have grown up and have been schooled to look at the world. And, culturally, in terms of stories that have predominated, so many of them are ultimately rooted in some way or another in the Second World War, whether that’s James Bond or Marvel comics or 'Star Trek.' You can see the influence of those six years of conflict just absolutely everywhere.”In taking on the lasting effects of the Second World War, Chabon has treaded into twenty-first-century political history as well. But he’s not sure whether his novel could be applied to the current moment, when many of his readers are grappling with the consequences of President-elect Donald Trump. “I’m a backwards-looking person; I’m a ruminator; I’m very good at figuring out what happened a while back, but not so great at guessing what is going to happen,” he said. Still, “Moonglow” is another scale model of love and death and catastrophe. It’s another reminder that we live in a broken world. And fiction, Chabon said, “is an attempt to mend it.”Cody Delistraty is a writer and researcher based in Paris.Read more »Cody Delistraty is a writer and researcher based in Paris.Read more »Dive into the world of literature with The New Yorker’s weekly fiction newsletter.SubmitSubmitMost Popular1.A Reporter at LargeGuantánamo’s Darkest SecretBy Ben Taub2.News DeskSecrecy, Self-Dealing, and Greed at the N.R.A.By Mike Spies3.Letter from Trump’s WashingtonThe Mueller Report Won’t End Trump’s Presidency, But It Sure Makes Him Look BadBy Susan B.
