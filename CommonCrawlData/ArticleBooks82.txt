By Sarah LarsonJune 3, 2016Illustration from “Stuart Little.”On March 30, 1945, the great children’s-book editor Ursula Nordstrom sent a letter to Katharine S. White, an editor at this magazine and the wife of E. B. White, enclosing the contract for the publication of “Stuart Little.” Nordstrom also included sketches by several possible illustrators, many highly regarded. Don Freeman, later known for the wonderful “Corduroy,” was among them. Nordstrom wrote, “He is a good artist, but he sees Stuart as a rather zoot-suited character.… I also enclose some drawings by Garth Williams.”Williams was thirty-three and not well known. Nordstrom explained that she had conveyed to him Katharine White’s thoughts about proportion, recommending the approach of Ernest Shepard’s illustrations of Toad and Mole in “The Wind in the Willows,” in which scale was somewhat flexible. Williams had found that difficult, “because Stuart’s size is mentioned so often.”Mr. Williams felt that since, for instance, a dime can come up to Stuart’s waist, he (Mr. Williams) should be pretty consistent in the proportions in most of the pictures. (This sounds very dull and literal, I’m afraid, but Mr. Williams didn’t mean it that way and, in fact, said it all much better than I am saying it.) .... He was careful about lots of small but important details. For instance, in the picture of the doctor examining Stuart, Stuart is standing up. Mr. Williams had him lying down in the first sketch but changed it because he was afraid he might look like a little dead mouse if he were lying down. (That is probably a silly detail to pass on to you, but it was somehow encouraging to us.)Williams was hired; he went on to become one of the most important children’s-book illustrators in American history. In “Stuart Little,” the hallmarks of his style are already apparent: Stuart was both mouselike and dapper, anthropomorphized in a way that expressed the dignity and absurdity of the human condition and the animal condition alike. Stuart was not a cartoon character. He was as serious and playful as White’s text. In Williams’s illustration, Stuart’s clothespin-and-cigarette-box bed is irresistibly charming but rumpled and untidy, surrounded by the playful flotsam of a rambunctious kid’s bedroom. The haimish mood recalls the work of Robert McCloskey, in books such as “One Morning in Maine,” which pairs the joys, spilled milk, and sleepy tooth-brushing of everyday life with the sublime wonders of the rocky Maine coast. It’s a world view that expresses realism and reassurance together.Williams illustrated more than eighty books in the course of his life, including “Charlotte’s Web”; “The Cricket in Times Square,” by George Selden; “Bedtime for Frances,” by Russell Hoban (Williams rightly suggested that Frances be a badger, not a vole); several collaborations with his friend Margaret Wise Brown (the author of “Goodnight Moon”), including the weird and wonderful “Mister Dog” and “The Little Fur Family”; and Laura Ingalls Wilder’s “Little House” series, which Nordstrom commissioned him to re-illustrate in its entirety. Williams’s illustrations for those and other books are an indelible part of twentieth-century American childhood: Wilbur joyfully leaping off a manure pile; Laura Ingalls frolicking on the sod-house roof in Plum Creek; Stuart sailing his ship across the Central Park Pond; Crispin’s Crispian smoking his pipe; Harry Cat, Tucker Mouse, and Chester Cricket shooting the breeze at the newsstand in Times Square. His animals are at once fur-faced and contemplative, inhabiting a tender realm whose coziness comes from the joys of the natural world and of unconventional friendships.The invaluable “Dear Genius: The Letters of Ursula Nordstrom,” edited by Leonard Marcus, from 1998, provides an intriguing window onto the collaboration between Williams and many of the writers whose books he illustrated, including White, Brown, Hoban, and Wilder, and with Nordstrom herself, whose writing is so vivid and affectionate that you feel like you know her and wish you had. (I often find myself wishing for a “Dear Genius II.”) And, this month, an insightful and thorough biography, “Garth Williams, American Illustrator: A Life,” by the Boston College professors Elizabeth K. Wallace and James D. Wallace, will be published by Beaufort Books. Writing it was no simple undertaking. As the authors point out in the first chapter, Williams himself struggled through a decades-long attempt at writing his life story. “His wide-ranging experiences—including his early promise as a sculptor, his service in London during the Blitz, his four marriages, six children, residences in New York, London, Rome, Aspen, Santa Fe, San Antonio, and Guanajuato Mexico,” as well as his many books, collaborations, and relationships, “defied an orderly narrative,” they write. The stories behind these biographical details remind us of both the tumult of the twentieth century and the tumult of the artistic temperament, and the book’s chapters on “Charlotte’s Web,” “A Cricket in Times Square,” and the “Little House” books, as well as its portrait of Williams’s friendship with Margaret Wise Brown, are especially satisfying.The collaboration between Williams and E. B. White was successful but not always easy. During the illustration process for “Charlotte’s Web,” Nordstrom wrote to White, “Garth wants to meet the challenge of doing a close-up of a spider, he says. But when he comes right up to it he doesn’t meet it by giving her a face.” Nobody wanted to overly anthropomorphize Charlotte; neither did they want her to be a monster. It’s hard to imagine White’s sensitive text, illustrated in Williams’s warmly effusive style, with an arachnid heroine who has eight eyes looking in all directions. As John Updike wrote of “Charlotte’s Web” in The New Yorker in 1999, E. B. White’s centennial year, “A real spider has eight eyes and two big fangs, as a number of illustrations consulted by White … repulsively show. Murder and manure could make it into the nature of ‘Charlotte’s Web,’ but not merciless sideways fangs.” Williams tried, at first, to give Charlotte a human face, an idea that White found “horrible.” Writer and illustrator, delicately mediated by Nordstrom, arrived at a compromise: Charlotte is shown looking down, her top two eyes visible as she weaves. This was White’s idea. “I contend he cheated,” Williams later said.The tension between nature and art, real life and depicted life, is a theme of Williams’s work and of his biography. When the “Little House” books were first published, beginning in the thirties, the illustrations, primarily by Helen Sewell, had an Old World quality, with a visual style that evokes fairy tales and woodcuts. Sewell had grown up partly in tropical climates; she drew a “lush, highly stylized version of nature,” as the Wallaces put it, more suggestive of banyan trees than of the flora of the American Midwest. The humans, too, are highly stylized: static, simplified.Williams and his wife Dorothea, shortly after their wedding, in 1945. Courtesy The Garth Williams ArchiveWilliams took an entirely different approach—one that familiarizes, not distances, the pioneer life that it portrays. He visited Wilder’s daughter at her farmhouse in Connecticut, who encouraged him to visit Wilder herself, “assuring him that her mother was sharp-minded and likely to be responsive to him.” In September, 1947, Williams and his wife and daughter went to meet Wilder and to research “the people, landscape, buildings, and artifacts that he would later need to draw.” The suggested route “took the family south from New York State through the great Smoky Mountains, then west to Mansfield, Missouri. Williams found Mrs. Wilder weeding her garden.” Almanzo, Wilder’s husband, “was still doing chores at the age of eighty.” Williams and Wilder talked about the books’ details, including the location of her father’s fiddle; she shared family photographs, which he made sketches of; and then he continued along, driving to the sites described in the books. “I drove south to the shores of Lake Henry and on beyond where your first school must have been,” he wrote to Wilder. “I almost saw Almanzo driving out to fetch you home across the endless snow. For a long time I peered into the windows of a house just south of the big slough; and I have never seen or known such an enormous sky…. I completely felt the minuteness of the people & carts & houses—out in a prairie.”He also found the site of the sod house in “On the Banks of Plum Creek.” He later wrote:An architect would have described the sod house on the bank of Plum Creek as extremely primitive, unhealthy and undesirable—nothing to seal the walls from dampness, no ventilation, no light. But to Laura’s fresh young eyes it was a pleasant house, surrounded by flowers and with the music of a running stream and rustling leaves. She understood the meaning of hardship and struggle, of joy and work, of shyness and bravery. She was never overcome by drabness or squalor. She never glamorized anything; yet she saw the loveliness in everything. This was the way the illustrator had to follow—no glamorizing for him either; no giving everyone a permanent wave.Unlike Sewell, Williams foregrounded the harsh side of nature as well as its loveliness, drawing roiling rivers, blasting wind, “the way an injury swells Ma’s foot to an enormous size.” He drew life as it was, beauty and realism together. “From Williams’ pictures, readers—many of whom lived far from a rural setting—could see exactly what a bear trap looked like,” the Wallaces write, as well as maple-syrup-sapping equipment, the size of a butter churn in relation to a small child’s hands, and even, after Wilder’s description of Pa slaughtering the family pig, Laura and Mary playing with the pig’s bladder, after it had been inflated and tied with a string. His approach resulted in a series whose illustrations matched its author’s perspective; together, they helped children understand the American past.Beloved children’s books are often re-illustrated, sometimes badly; too often, the visual subtlety of earlier illustrations is lost. They’re also made into movies, in which subtlety can be obliterated. (The trailer for the 1999 C.G.I. “Stuart Little” is cause for despair; I refuse to recognize the live-action “Harriet the Spy,” because Louise Fitzhugh’s writing and illustrations, together, are perfect.) Happily, Williams’s work has stayed in print, and for the books he illustrated, many of them classics, the illustrations are integral and essential. “Charlotte’s Web” has sold a staggering number of copies—more than twenty-five million as of its sixtieth anniversary—and its images are part of our collective cultural consciousness.In 2005, Roger Angell, Katharine White’s son and E. B. White’s stepson, wrote a piece about his stepfather, familiarly known as Andy, in this magazine. It included an anecdote about a Garth Williams illustration and the barn whose inhabitants had inspired “Charlotte’s Web.”Many in the family, including my children, have their own lasting and complex attachments to Andy and the Whites’ place. My daughter Alice, at about ten—an age when she’d read and been read “Charlotte’s Web” over and over again—was shocked to learn that a young pig in residence in an enclosure to the southwest of the garage would be converted to ham and bacon shortly after her departure in September. She worked late that evening, crayoning a large replica of Garth Williams’s “SOME PIG!” drawing in the book—the miracle web that saves Wilbur—and had me drive her back to the Whites’ that night, so she could secretly thumbtack it to the side of the pen. The agrarian Andy was startled but unmoved, and the pig went to his smoked reward on schedule.Sarah Larson is a staff writer at The New Yorker.

Williams found Mrs. Wilder weeding her garden.” Almanzo, Wilder’s husband, “was still doing chores at the age of eighty.” Williams and Wilder talked about the books’ details, including the location of her father’s fiddle; she shared family photographs, which he made sketches of; and then he continued along, driving to the sites described in the books. “I drove south to the shores of Lake Henry and on beyond where your first school must have been,” he wrote to Wilder. “I almost saw Almanzo driving out to fetch you home across the endless snow. For a long time I peered into the windows of a house just south of the big slough; and I have never seen or known such an enormous sky…. I completely felt the minuteness of the people & carts & houses—out in a prairie.”He also found the site of the sod house in “On the Banks of Plum Creek.” He later wrote:An architect would have described the sod house on the bank of Plum Creek as extremely primitive, unhealthy and undesirable—nothing to seal the walls from dampness, no ventilation, no light. But to Laura’s fresh young eyes it was a pleasant house, surrounded by flowers and with the music of a running stream and rustling leaves. She understood the meaning of hardship and struggle, of joy and work, of shyness and bravery. She was never overcome by drabness or squalor. She never glamorized anything; yet she saw the loveliness in everything. This was the way the illustrator had to follow—no glamorizing for him either; no giving everyone a permanent wave.Unlike Sewell, Williams foregrounded the harsh side of nature as well as its loveliness, drawing roiling rivers, blasting wind, “the way an injury swells Ma’s foot to an enormous size.” He drew life as it was, beauty and realism together. “From Williams’ pictures, readers—many of whom lived far from a rural setting—could see exactly what a bear trap looked like,” the Wallaces write, as well as maple-syrup-sapping equipment, the size of a butter churn in relation to a small child’s hands, and even, after Wilder’s description of Pa slaughtering the family pig, Laura and Mary playing with the pig’s bladder, after it had been inflated and tied with a string. His approach resulted in a series whose illustrations matched its author’s perspective; together, they helped children understand the American past.Beloved children’s books are often re-illustrated, sometimes badly; too often, the visual subtlety of earlier illustrations is lost. They’re also made into movies, in which subtlety can be obliterated. (The trailer for the 1999 C.G.I. “Stuart Little” is cause for despair; I refuse to recognize the live-action “Harriet the Spy,” because Louise Fitzhugh’s writing and illustrations, together, are perfect.) Happily, Williams’s work has stayed in print, and for the books he illustrated, many of them classics, the illustrations are integral and essential. “Charlotte’s Web” has sold a staggering number of copies—more than twenty-five million as of its sixtieth anniversary—and its images are part of our collective cultural consciousness.In 2005, Roger Angell, Katharine White’s son and E. B. White’s stepson, wrote a piece about his stepfather, familiarly known as Andy, in this magazine. It included an anecdote about a Garth Williams illustration and the barn whose inhabitants had inspired “Charlotte’s Web.”Many in the family, including my children, have their own lasting and complex attachments to Andy and the Whites’ place. My daughter Alice, at about ten—an age when she’d read and been read “Charlotte’s Web” over and over again—was shocked to learn that a young pig in residence in an enclosure to the southwest of the garage would be converted to ham and bacon shortly after her departure in September. She worked late that evening, crayoning a large replica of Garth Williams’s “SOME PIG!” drawing in the book—the miracle web that saves Wilbur—and had me drive her back to the Whites’ that night, so she could secretly thumbtack it to the side of the pen. The agrarian Andy was startled but unmoved, and the pig went to his smoked reward on schedule.Sarah Larson is a staff writer at The New Yorker.

White, an editor at this magazine and the wife of E. B. White, enclosing the contract for the publication of “Stuart Little.” Nordstrom also included sketches by several possible illustrators, many highly regarded. Don Freeman, later known for the wonderful “Corduroy,” was among them. Nordstrom wrote, “He is a good artist, but he sees Stuart as a rather zoot-suited character.… I also enclose some drawings by Garth Williams.”Williams was thirty-three and not well known. Nordstrom explained that she had conveyed to him Katharine White’s thoughts about proportion, recommending the approach of Ernest Shepard’s illustrations of Toad and Mole in “The Wind in the Willows,” in which scale was somewhat flexible. Williams had found that difficult, “because Stuart’s size is mentioned so often.”Mr. Williams felt that since, for instance, a dime can come up to Stuart’s waist, he (Mr. Williams) should be pretty consistent in the proportions in most of the pictures. (This sounds very dull and literal, I’m afraid, but Mr. Williams didn’t mean it that way and, in fact, said it all much better than I am saying it.) .... He was careful about lots of small but important details. For instance, in the picture of the doctor examining Stuart, Stuart is standing up. Mr. Williams had him lying down in the first sketch but changed it because he was afraid he might look like a little dead mouse if he were lying down. (That is probably a silly detail to pass on to you, but it was somehow encouraging to us.)Williams was hired; he went on to become one of the most important children’s-book illustrators in American history. In “Stuart Little,” the hallmarks of his style are already apparent: Stuart was both mouselike and dapper, anthropomorphized in a way that expressed the dignity and absurdity of the human condition and the animal condition alike. Stuart was not a cartoon character. He was as serious and playful as White’s text. In Williams’s illustration, Stuart’s clothespin-and-cigarette-box bed is irresistibly charming but rumpled and untidy, surrounded by the playful flotsam of a rambunctious kid’s bedroom. The haimish mood recalls the work of Robert McCloskey, in books such as “One Morning in Maine,” which pairs the joys, spilled milk, and sleepy tooth-brushing of everyday life with the sublime wonders of the rocky Maine coast. It’s a world view that expresses realism and reassurance together.Williams illustrated more than eighty books in the course of his life, including “Charlotte’s Web”; “The Cricket in Times Square,” by George Selden; “Bedtime for Frances,” by Russell Hoban (Williams rightly suggested that Frances be a badger, not a vole); several collaborations with his friend Margaret Wise Brown (the author of “Goodnight Moon”), including the weird and wonderful “Mister Dog” and “The Little Fur Family”; and Laura Ingalls Wilder’s “Little House” series, which Nordstrom commissioned him to re-illustrate in its entirety. Williams’s illustrations for those and other books are an indelible part of twentieth-century American childhood: Wilbur joyfully leaping off a manure pile; Laura Ingalls frolicking on the sod-house roof in Plum Creek; Stuart sailing his ship across the Central Park Pond; Crispin’s Crispian smoking his pipe; Harry Cat, Tucker Mouse, and Chester Cricket shooting the breeze at the newsstand in Times Square. His animals are at once fur-faced and contemplative, inhabiting a tender realm whose coziness comes from the joys of the natural world and of unconventional friendships.The invaluable “Dear Genius: The Letters of Ursula Nordstrom,” edited by Leonard Marcus, from 1998, provides an intriguing window onto the collaboration between Williams and many of the writers whose books he illustrated, including White, Brown, Hoban, and Wilder, and with Nordstrom herself, whose writing is so vivid and affectionate that you feel like you know her and wish you had. (I often find myself wishing for a “Dear Genius II.”) And, this month, an insightful and thorough biography, “Garth Williams, American Illustrator: A Life,” by the Boston College professors Elizabeth K. Wallace and James D. Wallace, will be published by Beaufort Books. Writing it was no simple undertaking. As the authors point out in the first chapter, Williams himself struggled through a decades-long attempt at writing his life story. “His wide-ranging experiences—including his early promise as a sculptor, his service in London during the Blitz, his four marriages, six children, residences in New York, London, Rome, Aspen, Santa Fe, San Antonio, and Guanajuato Mexico,” as well as his many books, collaborations, and relationships, “defied an orderly narrative,” they write. The stories behind these biographical details remind us of both the tumult of the twentieth century and the tumult of the artistic temperament, and the book’s chapters on “Charlotte’s Web,” “A Cricket in Times Square,” and the “Little House” books, as well as its portrait of Williams’s friendship with Margaret Wise Brown, are especially satisfying.The collaboration between Williams and E. B. White was successful but not always easy. During the illustration process for “Charlotte’s Web,” Nordstrom wrote to White, “Garth wants to meet the challenge of doing a close-up of a spider, he says. But when he comes right up to it he doesn’t meet it by giving her a face.” Nobody wanted to overly anthropomorphize Charlotte; neither did they want her to be a monster. It’s hard to imagine White’s sensitive text, illustrated in Williams’s warmly effusive style, with an arachnid heroine who has eight eyes looking in all directions. As John Updike wrote of “Charlotte’s Web” in The New Yorker in 1999, E. B. White’s centennial year, “A real spider has eight eyes and two big fangs, as a number of illustrations consulted by White … repulsively show. Murder and manure could make it into the nature of ‘Charlotte’s Web,’ but not merciless sideways fangs.” Williams tried, at first, to give Charlotte a human face, an idea that White found “horrible.” Writer and illustrator, delicately mediated by Nordstrom, arrived at a compromise: Charlotte is shown looking down, her top two eyes visible as she weaves. This was White’s idea. “I contend he cheated,” Williams later said.The tension between nature and art, real life and depicted life, is a theme of Williams’s work and of his biography. When the “Little House” books were first published, beginning in the thirties, the illustrations, primarily by Helen Sewell, had an Old World quality, with a visual style that evokes fairy tales and woodcuts. Sewell had grown up partly in tropical climates; she drew a “lush, highly stylized version of nature,” as the Wallaces put it, more suggestive of banyan trees than of the flora of the American Midwest. The humans, too, are highly stylized: static, simplified.Williams and his wife Dorothea, shortly after their wedding, in 1945. Courtesy The Garth Williams Archive

He visited Wilder’s daughter at her farmhouse in Connecticut, who encouraged him to visit Wilder herself, “assuring him that her mother was sharp-minded and likely to be responsive to him.” In September, 1947, Williams and his wife and daughter went to meet Wilder and to research “the people, landscape, buildings, and artifacts that he would later need to draw.” The suggested route “took the family south from New York State through the great Smoky Mountains, then west to Mansfield, Missouri. Williams found Mrs. Wilder weeding her garden.” Almanzo, Wilder’s husband, “was still doing chores at the age of eighty.” Williams and Wilder talked about the books’ details, including the location of her father’s fiddle; she shared family photographs, which he made sketches of; and then he continued along, driving to the sites described in the books. “I drove south to the shores of Lake Henry and on beyond where your first school must have been,” he wrote to Wilder. “I almost saw Almanzo driving out to fetch you home across the endless snow. For a long time I peered into the windows of a house just south of the big slough; and I have never seen or known such an enormous sky…. I completely felt the minuteness of the people & carts & houses—out in a prairie.”He also found the site of the sod house in “On the Banks of Plum Creek.” He later wrote:An architect would have described the sod house on the bank of Plum Creek as extremely primitive, unhealthy and undesirable—nothing to seal the walls from dampness, no ventilation, no light. But to Laura’s fresh young eyes it was a pleasant house, surrounded by flowers and with the music of a running stream and rustling leaves. She understood the meaning of hardship and struggle, of joy and work, of shyness and bravery. She was never overcome by drabness or squalor. She never glamorized anything; yet she saw the loveliness in everything. This was the way the illustrator had to follow—no glamorizing for him either; no giving everyone a permanent wave.Unlike Sewell, Williams foregrounded the harsh side of nature as well as its loveliness, drawing roiling rivers, blasting wind, “the way an injury swells Ma’s foot to an enormous size.” He drew life as it was, beauty and realism together. “From Williams’ pictures, readers—many of whom lived far from a rural setting—could see exactly what a bear trap looked like,” the Wallaces write, as well as maple-syrup-sapping equipment, the size of a butter churn in relation to a small child’s hands, and even, after Wilder’s description of Pa slaughtering the family pig, Laura and Mary playing with the pig’s bladder, after it had been inflated and tied with a string. His approach resulted in a series whose illustrations matched its author’s perspective; together, they helped children understand the American past.Beloved children’s books are often re-illustrated, sometimes badly; too often, the visual subtlety of earlier illustrations is lost. They’re also made into movies, in which subtlety can be obliterated.

Happily, Williams’s work has stayed in print, and for the books he illustrated, many of them classics, the illustrations are integral and essential. “Charlotte’s Web” has sold a staggering number of copies—more than twenty-five million as of its sixtieth anniversary—and its images are part of our collective cultural consciousness.In 2005, Roger Angell, Katharine White’s son and E. B. White’s stepson, wrote a piece about his stepfather, familiarly known as Andy, in this magazine. It included an anecdote about a Garth Williams illustration and the barn whose inhabitants had inspired “Charlotte’s Web.”Many in the family, including my children, have their own lasting and complex attachments to Andy and the Whites’ place. My daughter Alice, at about ten—an age when she’d read and been read “Charlotte’s Web” over and over again—was shocked to learn that a young pig in residence in an enclosure to the southwest of the garage would be converted to ham and bacon shortly after her departure in September. She worked late that evening, crayoning a large replica of Garth Williams’s “SOME PIG!” drawing in the book—the miracle web that saves Wilbur—and had me drive her back to the Whites’ that night, so she could secretly thumbtack it to the side of the pen. The agrarian Andy was startled but unmoved, and the pig went to his smoked reward on schedule.Sarah Larson is a staff writer at The New Yorker.

White, an editor at this magazine and the wife of E. B. White, enclosing the contract for the publication of “Stuart Little.” Nordstrom also included sketches by several possible illustrators, many highly regarded. Don Freeman, later known for the wonderful “Corduroy,” was among them. Nordstrom wrote, “He is a good artist, but he sees Stuart as a rather zoot-suited character.… I also enclose some drawings by Garth Williams.”Williams was thirty-three and not well known. Nordstrom explained that she had conveyed to him Katharine White’s thoughts about proportion, recommending the approach of Ernest Shepard’s illustrations of Toad and Mole in “The Wind in the Willows,” in which scale was somewhat flexible. Williams had found that difficult, “because Stuart’s size is mentioned so often.”Mr. Williams felt that since, for instance, a dime can come up to Stuart’s waist, he (Mr. Williams) should be pretty consistent in the proportions in most of the pictures. (This sounds very dull and literal, I’m afraid, but Mr. Williams didn’t mean it that way and, in fact, said it all much better than I am saying it.) .... He was careful about lots of small but important details. For instance, in the picture of the doctor examining Stuart, Stuart is standing up. Mr. Williams had him lying down in the first sketch but changed it because he was afraid he might look like a little dead mouse if he were lying down. (That is probably a silly detail to pass on to you, but it was somehow encouraging to us.)Williams was hired; he went on to become one of the most important children’s-book illustrators in American history. In “Stuart Little,” the hallmarks of his style are already apparent: Stuart was both mouselike and dapper, anthropomorphized in a way that expressed the dignity and absurdity of the human condition and the animal condition alike. Stuart was not a cartoon character. He was as serious and playful as White’s text. In Williams’s illustration, Stuart’s clothespin-and-cigarette-box bed is irresistibly charming but rumpled and untidy, surrounded by the playful flotsam of a rambunctious kid’s bedroom. The haimish mood recalls the work of Robert McCloskey, in books such as “One Morning in Maine,” which pairs the joys, spilled milk, and sleepy tooth-brushing of everyday life with the sublime wonders of the rocky Maine coast. It’s a world view that expresses realism and reassurance together.Williams illustrated more than eighty books in the course of his life, including “Charlotte’s Web”; “The Cricket in Times Square,” by George Selden; “Bedtime for Frances,” by Russell Hoban (Williams rightly suggested that Frances be a badger, not a vole); several collaborations with his friend Margaret Wise Brown (the author of “Goodnight Moon”), including the weird and wonderful “Mister Dog” and “The Little Fur Family”; and Laura Ingalls Wilder’s “Little House” series, which Nordstrom commissioned him to re-illustrate in its entirety. Williams’s illustrations for those and other books are an indelible part of twentieth-century American childhood: Wilbur joyfully leaping off a manure pile; Laura Ingalls frolicking on the sod-house roof in Plum Creek; Stuart sailing his ship across the Central Park Pond; Crispin’s Crispian smoking his pipe; Harry Cat, Tucker Mouse, and Chester Cricket shooting the breeze at the newsstand in Times Square. His animals are at once fur-faced and contemplative, inhabiting a tender realm whose coziness comes from the joys of the natural world and of unconventional friendships.The invaluable “Dear Genius: The Letters of Ursula Nordstrom,” edited by Leonard Marcus, from 1998, provides an intriguing window onto the collaboration between Williams and many of the writers whose books he illustrated, including White, Brown, Hoban, and Wilder, and with Nordstrom herself, whose writing is so vivid and affectionate that you feel like you know her and wish you had. (I often find myself wishing for a “Dear Genius II.”) And, this month, an insightful and thorough biography, “Garth Williams, American Illustrator: A Life,” by the Boston College professors Elizabeth K. Wallace and James D. Wallace, will be published by Beaufort Books. Writing it was no simple undertaking. As the authors point out in the first chapter, Williams himself struggled through a decades-long attempt at writing his life story. “His wide-ranging experiences—including his early promise as a sculptor, his service in London during the Blitz, his four marriages, six children, residences in New York, London, Rome, Aspen, Santa Fe, San Antonio, and Guanajuato Mexico,” as well as his many books, collaborations, and relationships, “defied an orderly narrative,” they write. The stories behind these biographical details remind us of both the tumult of the twentieth century and the tumult of the artistic temperament, and the book’s chapters on “Charlotte’s Web,” “A Cricket in Times Square,” and the “Little House” books, as well as its portrait of Williams’s friendship with Margaret Wise Brown, are especially satisfying.The collaboration between Williams and E. B. White was successful but not always easy. During the illustration process for “Charlotte’s Web,” Nordstrom wrote to White, “Garth wants to meet the challenge of doing a close-up of a spider, he says. But when he comes right up to it he doesn’t meet it by giving her a face.” Nobody wanted to overly anthropomorphize Charlotte; neither did they want her to be a monster. It’s hard to imagine White’s sensitive text, illustrated in Williams’s warmly effusive style, with an arachnid heroine who has eight eyes looking in all directions. As John Updike wrote of “Charlotte’s Web” in The New Yorker in 1999, E. B. White’s centennial year, “A real spider has eight eyes and two big fangs, as a number of illustrations consulted by White … repulsively show. Murder and manure could make it into the nature of ‘Charlotte’s Web,’ but not merciless sideways fangs.” Williams tried, at first, to give Charlotte a human face, an idea that White found “horrible.” Writer and illustrator, delicately mediated by Nordstrom, arrived at a compromise: Charlotte is shown looking down, her top two eyes visible as she weaves. This was White’s idea. “I contend he cheated,” Williams later said.The tension between nature and art, real life and depicted life, is a theme of Williams’s work and of his biography. When the “Little House” books were first published, beginning in the thirties, the illustrations, primarily by Helen Sewell, had an Old World quality, with a visual style that evokes fairy tales and woodcuts. Sewell had grown up partly in tropical climates; she drew a “lush, highly stylized version of nature,” as the Wallaces put it, more suggestive of banyan trees than of the flora of the American Midwest. The humans, too, are highly stylized: static, simplified.Williams and his wife Dorothea, shortly after their wedding, in 1945. Courtesy The Garth Williams Archive
Courtesy The Garth Williams ArchiveWilliams took an entirely different approach—one that familiarizes, not distances, the pioneer life that it portrays. He visited Wilder’s daughter at her farmhouse in Connecticut, who encouraged him to visit Wilder herself, “assuring him that her mother was sharp-minded and likely to be responsive to him.” In September, 1947, Williams and his wife and daughter went to meet Wilder and to research “the people, landscape, buildings, and artifacts that he would later need to draw.” The suggested route “took the family south from New York State through the great Smoky Mountains, then west to Mansfield, Missouri. Williams found Mrs. Wilder weeding her garden.” Almanzo, Wilder’s husband, “was still doing chores at the age of eighty.” Williams and Wilder talked about the books’ details, including the location of her father’s fiddle; she shared family photographs, which he made sketches of; and then he continued along, driving to the sites described in the books. “I drove south to the shores of Lake Henry and on beyond where your first school must have been,” he wrote to Wilder. “I almost saw Almanzo driving out to fetch you home across the endless snow. For a long time I peered into the windows of a house just south of the big slough; and I have never seen or known such an enormous sky…. I completely felt the minuteness of the people & carts & houses—out in a prairie.”He also found the site of the sod house in “On the Banks of Plum Creek.” He later wrote:An architect would have described the sod house on the bank of Plum Creek as extremely primitive, unhealthy and undesirable—nothing to seal the walls from dampness, no ventilation, no light. But to Laura’s fresh young eyes it was a pleasant house, surrounded by flowers and with the music of a running stream and rustling leaves. She understood the meaning of hardship and struggle, of joy and work, of shyness and bravery. She was never overcome by drabness or squalor. She never glamorized anything; yet she saw the loveliness in everything. This was the way the illustrator had to follow—no glamorizing for him either; no giving everyone a permanent wave.Unlike Sewell, Williams foregrounded the harsh side of nature as well as its loveliness, drawing roiling rivers, blasting wind, “the way an injury swells Ma’s foot to an enormous size.” He drew life as it was, beauty and realism together. “From Williams’ pictures, readers—many of whom lived far from a rural setting—could see exactly what a bear trap looked like,” the Wallaces write, as well as maple-syrup-sapping equipment, the size of a butter churn in relation to a small child’s hands, and even, after Wilder’s description of Pa slaughtering the family pig, Laura and Mary playing with the pig’s bladder, after it had been inflated and tied with a string. His approach resulted in a series whose illustrations matched its author’s perspective; together, they helped children understand the American past.Beloved children’s books are often re-illustrated, sometimes badly; too often, the visual subtlety of earlier illustrations is lost. They’re also made into movies, in which subtlety can be obliterated.

This was the way the illustrator had to follow—no glamorizing for him either; no giving everyone a permanent wave.Unlike Sewell, Williams foregrounded the harsh side of nature as well as its loveliness, drawing roiling rivers, blasting wind, “the way an injury swells Ma’s foot to an enormous size.” He drew life as it was, beauty and realism together. “From Williams’ pictures, readers—many of whom lived far from a rural setting—could see exactly what a bear trap looked like,” the Wallaces write, as well as maple-syrup-sapping equipment, the size of a butter churn in relation to a small child’s hands, and even, after Wilder’s description of Pa slaughtering the family pig, Laura and Mary playing with the pig’s bladder, after it had been inflated and tied with a string. His approach resulted in a series whose illustrations matched its author’s perspective; together, they helped children understand the American past.Beloved children’s books are often re-illustrated, sometimes badly; too often, the visual subtlety of earlier illustrations is lost. They’re also made into movies, in which subtlety can be obliterated. (The trailer for the 1999 C.G.I. “Stuart Little” is cause for despair; I refuse to recognize the live-action “Harriet the Spy,” because Louise Fitzhugh’s writing and illustrations, together, are perfect.) Happily, Williams’s work has stayed in print, and for the books he illustrated, many of them classics, the illustrations are integral and essential. “Charlotte’s Web” has sold a staggering number of copies—more than twenty-five million as of its sixtieth anniversary—and its images are part of our collective cultural consciousness.In 2005, Roger Angell, Katharine White’s son and E. B. White’s stepson, wrote a piece about his stepfather, familiarly known as Andy, in this magazine. It included an anecdote about a Garth Williams illustration and the barn whose inhabitants had inspired “Charlotte’s Web.”Many in the family, including my children, have their own lasting and complex attachments to Andy and the Whites’ place. My daughter Alice, at about ten—an age when she’d read and been read “Charlotte’s Web” over and over again—was shocked to learn that a young pig in residence in an enclosure to the southwest of the garage would be converted to ham and bacon shortly after her departure in September. She worked late that evening, crayoning a large replica of Garth Williams’s “SOME PIG!” drawing in the book—the miracle web that saves Wilbur—and had me drive her back to the Whites’ that night, so she could secretly thumbtack it to the side of the pen. The agrarian Andy was startled but unmoved, and the pig went to his smoked reward on schedule.11Illustration from “Stuart Little.”Courtesy Estate of Garth Williams / HarperCollins PublishersOn March 30, 1945, the great children’s-book editor Ursula Nordstrom sent a letter to Katharine S. White, an editor at this magazine and the wife of E. B. White, enclosing the contract for the publication of “Stuart Little.” Nordstrom also included sketches by several possible illustrators, many highly regarded. Don Freeman, later known for the wonderful “Corduroy,” was among them. Nordstrom wrote, “He is a good artist, but he sees Stuart as a rather zoot-suited character.… I also enclose some drawings by Garth Williams.”Williams was thirty-three and not well known. Nordstrom explained that she had conveyed to him Katharine White’s thoughts about proportion, recommending the approach of Ernest Shepard’s illustrations of Toad and Mole in “The Wind in the Willows,” in which scale was somewhat flexible. Williams had found that difficult, “because Stuart’s size is mentioned so often.”Mr. Williams felt that since, for instance, a dime can come up to Stuart’s waist, he (Mr. Williams) should be pretty consistent in the proportions in most of the pictures. (This sounds very dull and literal, I’m afraid, but Mr. Williams didn’t mean it that way and, in fact, said it all much better than I am saying it.) .... He was careful about lots of small but important details. For instance, in the picture of the doctor examining Stuart, Stuart is standing up. Mr. Williams had him lying down in the first sketch but changed it because he was afraid he might look like a little dead mouse if he were lying down. (That is probably a silly detail to pass on to you, but it was somehow encouraging to us.)Williams was hired; he went on to become one of the most important children’s-book illustrators in American history. In “Stuart Little,” the hallmarks of his style are already apparent: Stuart was both mouselike and dapper, anthropomorphized in a way that expressed the dignity and absurdity of the human condition and the animal condition alike. Stuart was not a cartoon character. He was as serious and playful as White’s text. In Williams’s illustration, Stuart’s clothespin-and-cigarette-box bed is irresistibly charming but rumpled and untidy, surrounded by the playful flotsam of a rambunctious kid’s bedroom. The haimish mood recalls the work of Robert McCloskey, in books such as “One Morning in Maine,” which pairs the joys, spilled milk, and sleepy tooth-brushing of everyday life with the sublime wonders of the rocky Maine coast. It’s a world view that expresses realism and reassurance together.Williams illustrated more than eighty books in the course of his life, including “Charlotte’s Web”; “The Cricket in Times Square,” by George Selden; “Bedtime for Frances,” by Russell Hoban (Williams rightly suggested that Frances be a badger, not a vole); several collaborations with his friend Margaret Wise Brown (the author of “Goodnight Moon”), including the weird and wonderful “Mister Dog” and “The Little Fur Family”; and Laura Ingalls Wilder’s “Little House” series, which Nordstrom commissioned him to re-illustrate in its entirety. Williams’s illustrations for those and other books are an indelible part of twentieth-century American childhood: Wilbur joyfully leaping off a manure pile; Laura Ingalls frolicking on the sod-house roof in Plum Creek; Stuart sailing his ship across the Central Park Pond; Crispin’s Crispian smoking his pipe; Harry Cat, Tucker Mouse, and Chester Cricket shooting the breeze at the newsstand in Times Square. His animals are at once fur-faced and contemplative, inhabiting a tender realm whose coziness comes from the joys of the natural world and of unconventional friendships.The invaluable “Dear Genius: The Letters of Ursula Nordstrom,” edited by Leonard Marcus, from 1998, provides an intriguing window onto the collaboration between Williams and many of the writers whose books he illustrated, including White, Brown, Hoban, and Wilder, and with Nordstrom herself, whose writing is so vivid and affectionate that you feel like you know her and wish you had. (I often find myself wishing for a “Dear Genius II.”) And, this month, an insightful and thorough biography, “Garth Williams, American Illustrator: A Life,” by the Boston College professors Elizabeth K. Wallace and James D. Wallace, will be published by Beaufort Books. Writing it was no simple undertaking. As the authors point out in the first chapter, Williams himself struggled through a decades-long attempt at writing his life story. “His wide-ranging experiences—including his early promise as a sculptor, his service in London during the Blitz, his four marriages, six children, residences in New York, London, Rome, Aspen, Santa Fe, San Antonio, and Guanajuato Mexico,” as well as his many books, collaborations, and relationships, “defied an orderly narrative,” they write. The stories behind these biographical details remind us of both the tumult of the twentieth century and the tumult of the artistic temperament, and the book’s chapters on “Charlotte’s Web,” “A Cricket in Times Square,” and the “Little House” books, as well as its portrait of Williams’s friendship with Margaret Wise Brown, are especially satisfying.The collaboration between Williams and E. B. White was successful but not always easy. During the illustration process for “Charlotte’s Web,” Nordstrom wrote to White, “Garth wants to meet the challenge of doing a close-up of a spider, he says. But when he comes right up to it he doesn’t meet it by giving her a face.” Nobody wanted to overly anthropomorphize Charlotte; neither did they want her to be a monster. It’s hard to imagine White’s sensitive text, illustrated in Williams’s warmly effusive style, with an arachnid heroine who has eight eyes looking in all directions. As John Updike wrote of “Charlotte’s Web” in The New Yorker in 1999, E. B. White’s centennial year, “A real spider has eight eyes and two big fangs, as a number of illustrations consulted by White … repulsively show. Murder and manure could make it into the nature of ‘Charlotte’s Web,’ but not merciless sideways fangs.” Williams tried, at first, to give Charlotte a human face, an idea that White found “horrible.” Writer and illustrator, delicately mediated by Nordstrom, arrived at a compromise: Charlotte is shown looking down, her top two eyes visible as she weaves. This was White’s idea. “I contend he cheated,” Williams later said.The tension between nature and art, real life and depicted life, is a theme of Williams’s work and of his biography. When the “Little House” books were first published, beginning in the thirties, the illustrations, primarily by Helen Sewell, had an Old World quality, with a visual style that evokes fairy tales and woodcuts. Sewell had grown up partly in tropical climates; she drew a “lush, highly stylized version of nature,” as the Wallaces put it, more suggestive of banyan trees than of the flora of the American Midwest. The humans, too, are highly stylized: static, simplified.Williams and his wife Dorothea, shortly after their wedding, in 1945. Courtesy The Garth Williams Archive
Courtesy The Garth Williams ArchiveWilliams took an entirely different approach—one that familiarizes, not distances, the pioneer life that it portrays. He visited Wilder’s daughter at her farmhouse in Connecticut, who encouraged him to visit Wilder herself, “assuring him that her mother was sharp-minded and likely to be responsive to him.” In September, 1947, Williams and his wife and daughter went to meet Wilder and to research “the people, landscape, buildings, and artifacts that he would later need to draw.” The suggested route “took the family south from New York State through the great Smoky Mountains, then west to Mansfield, Missouri. Williams found Mrs. Wilder weeding her garden.” Almanzo, Wilder’s husband, “was still doing chores at the age of eighty.” Williams and Wilder talked about the books’ details, including the location of her father’s fiddle; she shared family photographs, which he made sketches of; and then he continued along, driving to the sites described in the books. “I drove south to the shores of Lake Henry and on beyond where your first school must have been,” he wrote to Wilder. “I almost saw Almanzo driving out to fetch you home across the endless snow. For a long time I peered into the windows of a house just south of the big slough; and I have never seen or known such an enormous sky…. I completely felt the minuteness of the people & carts & houses—out in a prairie.”He also found the site of the sod house in “On the Banks of Plum Creek.” He later wrote:An architect would have described the sod house on the bank of Plum Creek as extremely primitive, unhealthy and undesirable—nothing to seal the walls from dampness, no ventilation, no light. But to Laura’s fresh young eyes it was a pleasant house, surrounded by flowers and with the music of a running stream and rustling leaves. She understood the meaning of hardship and struggle, of joy and work, of shyness and bravery. She was never overcome by drabness or squalor. She never glamorized anything; yet she saw the loveliness in everything. This was the way the illustrator had to follow—no glamorizing for him either; no giving everyone a permanent wave.Unlike Sewell, Williams foregrounded the harsh side of nature as well as its loveliness, drawing roiling rivers, blasting wind, “the way an injury swells Ma’s foot to an enormous size.” He drew life as it was, beauty and realism together. “From Williams’ pictures, readers—many of whom lived far from a rural setting—could see exactly what a bear trap looked like,” the Wallaces write, as well as maple-syrup-sapping equipment, the size of a butter churn in relation to a small child’s hands, and even, after Wilder’s description of Pa slaughtering the family pig, Laura and Mary playing with the pig’s bladder, after it had been inflated and tied with a string.
