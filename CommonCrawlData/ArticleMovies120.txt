Subscribe To Upcoming Disney Movies: Full List Of Titles And Release Dates UpdatesDisney has had some of the biggest box office years of any studio in the history of time over the last few years. While the studio only has a handful of films planned for 2019, almost every single one of them is poised to be a major blockbuster. And then, of course, there's everything they have planned after that.Between all the different studios that Disney owns, and with another having recently joined them, there's a nearly endless stream of movies planned for the rest of this decade. Here is everything currently on the official Disney release calendar, animated, live-action, comic book, and science fiction, even a documentary just to balance things out. This is your one-stop shop for all things Disney. Here's everything that has to yet to be released by the House of Mouse.Release Date: April 12, 2019Disney's next big release isn't likely to set pre-sale ticket records or smash the box office, but for a studio that has been in the documentary business almost as long as it's been in the animation business, it's nice that the studio still makes movies designed to educate even more than they're designed to entertain. You may not find this one easily at your major multiplex, but there's nothing wrong with seeking it out.Release Date: April 26, 2019It all comes down to this. After 22 films and 11 years the Marvel Cinematic Universe will come to a head with Avengers: Endgame. While the MCU will continue moving forward, we have no idea just what sort of shape it will be in. Who will live? Who will die? We certainly have no idea, and the only way to know for sure is to watch it and find out.Release Date: May 24, 2019Early looks at Aladdin had a lot of people worried. Whether it was Will Smith's Genie not being blue or the Genie being a little strange looking while being blue, fans of the animated original were less than thrilled. With the release of the first trailer, the fear seems to have largely calmed down. Considering how popular the original movie is, you can be sure Disney has high expectations for this one.Release Date: June 21, 2019Many would consider the first three Toy Story movies one of the finest trilogies in recent memory. The mere idea of a fourth film sends people into cold sweats, and yet, that film will be here soon. The story will see Woody reunited with his old flame Bo Peep as he and new friend Forky try to get back to Bonnie. The film appears to deal with questions of identity and purpose. There may be something left for this franchise to say after all.Release Date: July 5, 2019Technically, Spider-Man: Far From Home isn't a Disney movie, but rather a Sony film. However, since it's still part of the marvel Cinematic Universe, and that's all Disney, we're going to include it here. Exactly how Spider-Man will make it from the end of Avengers: Infinity War to here we don't yet know, but however it works, it will see Peter Parker visiting Europe with school friends, where he'll be pressed into service by Nick Fury.Release Date: July 19, 2019The original Lion King is still one of the biggest hits Disney Animation has ever had. One can only imagine what will happen when the story returns to the screen via the same CGI/animation style that brought the animal of The Jungle Book to life. Donald Glover will voice Simba, Chiwetel Ejiofor will voice Scar, and James Earl Jones will be back to reprise his role as Mufasa. The last time this movie nearly made a billion dollars at the box office. This time that number might be low.Release Date: August 9, 2019Artemis Fowl is based on a popular book series, but it's not exactly one on the level of Harry Potter. As such, it's hard to gauge how big this one will be. It could be a serious X-factor in the Disney schedule. If it hits as big as most of the movies on this list, it will almost certainly be the birth of a new franchise. If it doesn't it will likely be a footnote on an otherwise impressive box office year. We'll have to wait and see.After waiting years for the follow-up to the hit Maleficent Disney has decided not to waste any time. Originally set for a 2020 release, Maleficent: Mistress of Evil has been pushed up to the fall of 2019. It will be the first time we've seen Angelina Jolie in front of the camera in years. If she's as deliciously evil and fun as she was he first time around, this one will have been worth the wait.Release Date: October 18, 2019Disney is going to be competing with itself for the box office crown this year. While it seems like Avengers: Endgame will be rthe movie to beat, one should not discount the possibility that Frozen II could play spoiler. The first movie is Disney's biggest animated hit ever and the love that many have for that movie still hasn't died down all these years later. The trailer for the sequel looks to take things down a darker path, but if it has even just one song to become the new "Let it Go," that could be all it needs to be another big hit.Release Date: November 22, 2019Release Date: December 20, 2019At the end of 2019, a trilogy many of us thought we'd never see will be coming to an end. The third Star Wars trilogy, will finally give a conclusion to the story of Rey, Finn, Poe, and our classic favorites from the original films. The Last Jedi was a movie that split fans. It will be interesting to see if the new film tries to unite them, or continues to carry Star Wars in to new and different places as the franchise continues to grow.Of course, that's only what Disney has planned this year. Like most studios, Disney already has their film slate planned, in whole or in part, for years to come. Click over to see what's planned for 2020 and beyond.Release Date: March 6, 2020Release Date: March 27, 2020Release Date: July 24, 2020Release Date: July 9, 2021But wait, there's more! In addition to everything that Disney has publicly announced, they've also staked out several other release dates for movies that don't even have titles yet. We're guessing Disney has a pretty good idea what's going where, but we're still waiting for clarification.Release Date: February 14, 2020Release Date: May 1, 2020Release Date: June 19, 2020Release Date: October 9,, 2020Release Date: November 6, 2020Release Date: November 25, 2020Release Date: December 23, 2020Release Date: February 12, 2021Release Date: March 12, 2021Release Date: May 7, 2021Release Date: May 28,2021Release Date: June 18, 2021Release Date: July 30, 2021Release Date: October 8, 2021Release Date: November 5, 2021Release Date: November 24, 2021Release Date: December 23, 2021Release Date: February 18, 2022Release Date: March 18, 2022Release Date: May 6, 2022Release Date: May 27, 2022Release Date: June 17, 2022Release Date: July 8, 2022Release Date: July 29, 2022Release Date: October 7, 2022Release Date: November 4, 2022Release Date: November 23, 2022Release Date: December 22, 2022Release Date: February 17, 2023Disney's first step out of the gate in 2017 was a very high profile picture. Beauty and the Beast is quite possibly Disney's most beloved animated feature. As such, hopes -- and fears -- were running high with the live action version. It was the first live-action adaptation from Disney to be a full musical and while many loved hearing those songs again, for many the remake only reminded people how great the original was.Release Date: March 17, 2017While Disney built their reputation on animation, the studio has been making nature documentaries for almost as long. The latest of these, under the current Disneynature brand, was called Born in China. John Krasinski narrated this story of three animal families within the titular nation: giant pandas, golden monkeys, and snow leopards. While this film certainly didn't set the box office on fire, it was still as magical as anything Disney did in 2017.Release Date: April 21, 2017The Guardians of the Galaxy movie became one of Marvel's biggest hits. The less-than-serious tone appealed to fans, and had them laughing as much as cheering. While the team was largely an unknown quantity the first time around, they had a lot to live up to with the sequel. For the most part, they succeeded. The film was a box office hit with a surprisingly poignant and emotional story.Release Date: May 5, 2017The Pirates of the Caribbean movies started out great, and have been on a steady decline ever since. The newest entry, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales was a clear attempt to go back to the basics that made the first film work. With a new villain in Javier Bardem and the return of some classic characters, the film tried to recapture the magic. While the movie was a critical and box office flop, internationally the action adventure film still made hundreds of millions of dollars, which means the potential for more in this series is still out there.Release Date: May 26, 2017Who'd have ever guessed that one of the most interesting films on the way from Pixar would be the third entry in the Cars franchise? A teaser trailer that promised the movie would open with a near-death experience from main character Lightning McQueen is the last thing we expected to see. Pixar promised a more grounded and emotional story than we saw in Cars 2. While we certainly got that, the third entry in the franchise didn't really do enough to wow critics or audiences.Release Date: June 16, 2017Spider-Man joined Marvel's cinematic universe in Captain America: Civil War. Now that he's back in the fold, Marvel is wasted no time in putting their new wall-crawler front and center - and fans embraced him with open arms. Technically Spider-Man: Homecoming was both marketed and distributed by Sony Pictures (part of the deal made a few years ago), but because of the Disney-owned Marvel Studios' involvement on the creative side, we're counting it here.Release Date: July 7, 2017Thor has never been the brightest star in the MCU. Having said that, there were a lot of eyes on Thor: Ragnarok. The addition of director Taika Waititi promised a significantly different tone than the previous films. We certainly got that. Ragnarok was a much funnier and more thrilling version of the Asgardian than we had seen before. The film outdid all of Thor's previous outings at the box office and set him up nicely for the coming Infinity War.Release Date: November 3, 2017Coco is Pixar's lone original story on its current slate, surrounded on all sides by sequels. The story followed a young boy named Miguel with a passion for music. That music opened a door to the land of the dead, and sent Miguel on a journey that reunited him with lost family members. Coco was everything that we expect from Pixar, a studio who knows how to make their stories resonate with audiences. It's too early to tell if this is one of Pixar's all-time great films, but it certainly made the argument.Release Date: November 22, 2017Disney's 2017 ended in the same place that the previous couple years wrapped up, Star Wars. The middle episode of the current trilogy was helmed by Looper's Rian Johnson and while opinions on the film, on the whole, have been mixed, you can't argue that Johnson didn't get people talking. Some called The Last Jedi the best Star Wars movie ever, while others called it the worst. However you feel, it's clear that the franchise will never be the same again.Release Date: December 15, 2017Black Panther made his MCU debut in Captain America: Civil War and the character has the spotlight all to himself before Marvel's big crossover event begins later in the year. This will be the earliest in the year that we've seen a Marvel movie debut, but with the stacked calendar that Disney has this year, there was really no other place to put it. Expect Black Panther to set the table for Avengers: Infinity War coming later in the year. It will also set the tone for Disney's likely utter domination of the 2018 box office.Release Date: February 16, 2018Expectations are fairly high for Disney's big screen version of the popular novel A Wrinkle in Time. The great Ava DuVernay is directing the adaptation and it includes the likes of Oprah Winfrey, Mindy Kaling, Reese Witherspoon and Chris Pine. The trailers have shown the film to be everything that decades worth of fans of the book will likely want to see, with strange alien worlds and equally strange characters. While this movie has the potential to get buried underneath all the massive franchises, its fanbase is so potentially huge that if it breaks out, it could be one of the biggest movies of the year.Release Date: March 9, 2018What is there to say about the Marvel Cinematic Universe that hasn't already been said? It's celebrating its tenth anniversary in 2018, and to celebrate, it's starting the two-part event that is Avengers: Infinity War. We'll see virtually every character that the MCU has introduced in one place in what promises to be the biggest spectacle of the year. Infinity War is already looking like the film to beat at the box office in 2018. It seems unlikely any other movie is up to the challenge.Release Date: May 4, 2018Three weeks after Disney drops it's biggest Marvel movie in years, it will bring out the next entry in their other major franchise, Star Wars. Solo: A Star Wars Story will be the first of the new generation of Star Wars films to see a summer release; this despite the film seeing significant delays due to the directors being replaced in the middle of filming. Nobody is quite sure what to expect from the new movie that stars Alden Ehrenreich as the young smuggler, but it's Star Wars so you can be sure it will be big.Release Date: May 25, 2018Following on the success of Coco, Pixar will fall back on another familiar property and do what every other studio has done, make a sequel to a popular superhero movie. Of course, this is Pixar, so you can be sure that what we get will still be something special. The Incredibles was one of the best superhero movies ever made in the era before the MCU was a thing, and fans have certainly wanted to see a sequel to the superfamily drama. Indications are that Holly Hunter's Elastigirl will be taking center stage in the new film.Release Date: June 15, 2018Nobody knew quite what to expect when Ant-Man joined the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but what we got was a surprisingly fun, and funny, entry in the franchise. We know even less about how the sequel will work seeing as it's situated between the two Avengers films, but we know that Evangeline Lily will be donning her own costume as the Wasp and the movie will deal with an attempt to rescue Janet Van Dyne from the Quantum Realm.Release Date: July 6, 2018Disney's last live-action remake was Beauty and the Beast and it was the top movie at the box office for most of 2017. Christopher Robin isn't a remake so much as it is a sort of sequel that will see Ewan McGregor as a grown-up Christopher Robin who finds himself returning to the Hundred Acre Wood and reuniting with his old friends. Hayley Atwell co-stars in what may be Disney's most unique live-action follow-up to an animated film to date.Release Date: August 3, 2018The Nutcracker is a story familiar to millions of people, but the first trailers for The Nutcracker and the Four Realms shows that, as to be expected, the Disney version of the story will be something a little different. While the ballet that most people are familiar with will certainly be represented, what we've seen of the film shows that it will have almost Narnia like elements, as Clara won't simply dream of another world, but cross over into it, and travel to places that the ballet only references.Release Date: November 2, 2018To date, only The Rescuers has seen a direct theatrical sequel to the original effort that was actually produced by Disney's main animation studio, but that changes in November 2018 when Wreck-It Ralph gets a big screen follow-up. The new film will see Ralph and Vanellope Von Schweetz leave the video game world behind in order to take on the entire internet. While many details are still unclear, we do know the movie will see all of Disney's popular princesses make an appearance together, making this one a must view for Disney fans.Release Date: November 21, 2018Of all the remakes and sequels, the single most daring thing Disney has on the horizon is likely Mary Poppins Returns. The film, which is being produced as a direct sequel to the 1960s original, has Emily Blunt take on the role of the practically perfect nanny which originally won Julie Andrews an Academy Award. While only time will tell if the sequel will be quite that good, it certainly looks like Mary Poppins Returns wants to be, as the cast includes the great Lin-Manuel Miranda and the film is directed by the Oscar-nominated director of Chicago.Release Date: December 25, 2018While Captain Marvel is the big MCU movie set in between the two-part Avengers finale, it was set in the 1990s, predating most of the franchise. It introduced us to Brie Larson's new intergalactic hero, who promises to be a major part of Avengers: Endgame and beyond. It gave us a young Nick Fury and answered a couple of questions about the Marvel Cinematic Universe, while, of course, creating several more questions in the process.Release Date: March 8, 2019The first of three big Disney live-action remakes to hit the screen in 2019 was Dumbo. The earliest Disney animated theatrical film to receive the live-action treatment, the story about the flying elephant was spearheaded by Tim Burton and told a significantly different story, which created a collection of human characters around the baby elephant. While many praised the CGI which created the title character, the rest of the film was not viewed as favorably by many.Release Date: March 29, 2019

Penguins
Release Date: April 12, 2019
Disney's next big release isn't likely to set pre-sale ticket records or smash the box office, but for a studio that has been in the documentary business almost as long as it's been in the animation business, it's nice that the studio still makes movies designed to educate even more than they're designed to entertain. You may not find this one easily at your major multiplex, but there's nothing wrong with seeking it out.

Release Date: May 24, 2019
Early looks at Aladdin had a lot of people worried. Whether it was Will Smith's Genie not being blue or the Genie being a little strange looking while being blue, fans of the animated original were less than thrilled. With the release of the first trailer, the fear seems to have largely calmed down. Considering how popular the original movie is, you can be sure Disney has high expectations for this one.

Toy Story 4
Release Date: June 21, 2019
Many would consider the first three Toy Story movies one of the finest trilogies in recent memory. The mere idea of a fourth film sends people into cold sweats, and yet, that film will be here soon. The story will see Woody reunited with his old flame Bo Peep as he and new friend Forky try to get back to Bonnie. The film appears to deal with questions of identity and purpose. There may be something left for this franchise to say after all.

Spider-Man: Far From Home (Sony Produced MCU Movie)
Release Date: July 5, 2019
Technically, Spider-Man: Far From Home isn't a Disney movie, but rather a Sony film. However, since it's still part of the marvel Cinematic Universe, and that's all Disney, we're going to include it here. Exactly how Spider-Man will make it from the end of Avengers: Infinity War to here we don't yet know, but however it works, it will see Peter Parker visiting Europe with school friends, where he'll be pressed into service by Nick Fury.

The Lion King
Release Date: July 19, 2019
The original Lion King is still one of the biggest hits Disney Animation has ever had. One can only imagine what will happen when the story returns to the screen via the same CGI/animation style that brought the animal of The Jungle Book to life. Donald Glover will voice Simba, Chiwetel Ejiofor will voice Scar, and James Earl Jones will be back to reprise his role as Mufasa. The last time this movie nearly made a billion dollars at the box office. This time that number might be low.

Artemis Fowl
Release Date: August 9, 2019
Artemis Fowl is based on a popular book series, but it's not exactly one on the level of Harry Potter. As such, it's hard to gauge how big this one will be. It could be a serious X-factor in the Disney schedule. If it hits as big as most of the movies on this list, it will almost certainly be the birth of a new franchise. If it doesn't it will likely be a footnote on an otherwise impressive box office year. We'll have to wait and see.

Maleficent: Mistress of Evil
After waiting years for the follow-up to the hit Maleficent Disney has decided not to waste any time. Originally set for a 2020 release, Maleficent: Mistress of Evil has been pushed up to the fall of 2019. It will be the first time we've seen Angelina Jolie in front of the camera in years. If she's as deliciously evil and fun as she was he first time around, this one will have been worth the wait.

Frozen II
Disney is going to be competing with itself for the box office crown this year. While it seems like Avengers: Endgame will be rthe movie to beat, one should not discount the possibility that Frozen II could play spoiler. The first movie is Disney's biggest animated hit ever and the love that many have for that movie still hasn't died down all these years later. The trailer for the sequel looks to take things down a darker path, but if it has even just one song to become the new "Let it Go," that could be all it needs to be another big hit.

Star Wars: Episode IX
Release Date: December 20, 2019
At the end of 2019, a trilogy many of us thought we'd never see will be coming to an end. The third Star Wars trilogy, will finally give a conclusion to the story of Rey, Finn, Poe, and our classic favorites from the original films. The Last Jedi was a movie that split fans. It will be interesting to see if the new film tries to unite them, or continues to carry Star Wars in to new and different places as the franchise continues to grow.

Beauty and the Beast
Disney's first step out of the gate in 2017 was a very high profile picture. Beauty and the Beast is quite possibly Disney's most beloved animated feature. As such, hopes -- and fears -- were running high with the live action version. It was the first live-action adaptation from Disney to be a full musical and while many loved hearing those songs again, for many the remake only reminded people how great the original was.

Born in China
While Disney built their reputation on animation, the studio has been making nature documentaries for almost as long. The latest of these, under the current Disneynature brand, was called Born in China. John Krasinski narrated this story of three animal families within the titular nation: giant pandas, golden monkeys, and snow leopards. While this film certainly didn't set the box office on fire, it was still as magical as anything Disney did in 2017.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2
The Guardians of the Galaxy movie became one of Marvel's biggest hits. The less-than-serious tone appealed to fans, and had them laughing as much as cheering. While the team was largely an unknown quantity the first time around, they had a lot to live up to with the sequel. For the most part, they succeeded. The film was a box office hit with a surprisingly poignant and emotional story.

Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales
The Pirates of the Caribbean movies started out great, and have been on a steady decline ever since. The newest entry, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales was a clear attempt to go back to the basics that made the first film work. With a new villain in Javier Bardem and the return of some classic characters, the film tried to recapture the magic. While the movie was a critical and box office flop, internationally the action adventure film still made hundreds of millions of dollars, which means the potential for more in this series is still out there.

Cars 3
Who'd have ever guessed that one of the most interesting films on the way from Pixar would be the third entry in the Cars franchise? A teaser trailer that promised the movie would open with a near-death experience from main character Lightning McQueen is the last thing we expected to see. Pixar promised a more grounded and emotional story than we saw in Cars 2. While we certainly got that, the third entry in the franchise didn't really do enough to wow critics or audiences.

Spider-Man: Homecoming
Spider-Man joined Marvel's cinematic universe in Captain America: Civil War. Now that he's back in the fold, Marvel is wasted no time in putting their new wall-crawler front and center - and fans embraced him with open arms. Technically Spider-Man: Homecoming was both marketed and distributed by Sony Pictures (part of the deal made a few years ago), but because of the Disney-owned Marvel Studios' involvement on the creative side, we're counting it here.

Thor: Ragnarok
Thor has never been the brightest star in the MCU. Having said that, there were a lot of eyes on Thor: Ragnarok. The addition of director Taika Waititi promised a significantly different tone than the previous films. We certainly got that. Ragnarok was a much funnier and more thrilling version of the Asgardian than we had seen before. The film outdid all of Thor's previous outings at the box office and set him up nicely for the coming Infinity War.

Coco
Coco is Pixar's lone original story on its current slate, surrounded on all sides by sequels. The story followed a young boy named Miguel with a passion for music. That music opened a door to the land of the dead, and sent Miguel on a journey that reunited him with lost family members. Coco was everything that we expect from Pixar, a studio who knows how to make their stories resonate with audiences. It's too early to tell if this is one of Pixar's all-time great films, but it certainly made the argument.

Star Wars: The Last Jedi
Disney's 2017 ended in the same place that the previous couple years wrapped up, Star Wars. The middle episode of the current trilogy was helmed by Looper's Rian Johnson and while opinions on the film, on the whole, have been mixed, you can't argue that Johnson didn't get people talking. Some called The Last Jedi the best Star Wars movie ever, while others called it the worst. However you feel, it's clear that the franchise will never be the same again.

Black Panther
Black Panther made his MCU debut in Captain America: Civil War and the character has the spotlight all to himself before Marvel's big crossover event begins later in the year. This will be the earliest in the year that we've seen a Marvel movie debut, but with the stacked calendar that Disney has this year, there was really no other place to put it. Expect Black Panther to set the table for Avengers: Infinity War coming later in the year. It will also set the tone for Disney's likely utter domination of the 2018 box office.

A Wrinkle In Time
Expectations are fairly high for Disney's big screen version of the popular novel A Wrinkle in Time. The great Ava DuVernay is directing the adaptation and it includes the likes of Oprah Winfrey, Mindy Kaling, Reese Witherspoon and Chris Pine. The trailers have shown the film to be everything that decades worth of fans of the book will likely want to see, with strange alien worlds and equally strange characters. While this movie has the potential to get buried underneath all the massive franchises, its fanbase is so potentially huge that if it breaks out, it could be one of the biggest movies of the year.

Avengers: Infinity War
What is there to say about the Marvel Cinematic Universe that hasn't already been said? It's celebrating its tenth anniversary in 2018, and to celebrate, it's starting the two-part event that is Avengers: Infinity War. We'll see virtually every character that the MCU has introduced in one place in what promises to be the biggest spectacle of the year. Infinity War is already looking like the film to beat at the box office in 2018. It seems unlikely any other movie is up to the challenge.

Solo: A Star Wars Story
Three weeks after Disney drops it's biggest Marvel movie in years, it will bring out the next entry in their other major franchise, Star Wars. Solo: A Star Wars Story will be the first of the new generation of Star Wars films to see a summer release; this despite the film seeing significant delays due to the directors being replaced in the middle of filming. Nobody is quite sure what to expect from the new movie that stars Alden Ehrenreich as the young smuggler, but it's Star Wars so you can be sure it will be big.

The Incredibles 2
Following on the success of Coco, Pixar will fall back on another familiar property and do what every other studio has done, make a sequel to a popular superhero movie. Of course, this is Pixar, so you can be sure that what we get will still be something special. The Incredibles was one of the best superhero movies ever made in the era before the MCU was a thing, and fans have certainly wanted to see a sequel to the superfamily drama. Indications are that Holly Hunter's Elastigirl will be taking center stage in the new film.

Ant-Man and the Wasp
Nobody knew quite what to expect when Ant-Man joined the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but what we got was a surprisingly fun, and funny, entry in the franchise. We know even less about how the sequel will work seeing as it's situated between the two Avengers films, but we know that Evangeline Lily will be donning her own costume as the Wasp and the movie will deal with an attempt to rescue Janet Van Dyne from the Quantum Realm.

Christopher Robin
Disney's last live-action remake was Beauty and the Beast and it was the top movie at the box office for most of 2017. Christopher Robin isn't a remake so much as it is a sort of sequel that will see Ewan McGregor as a grown-up Christopher Robin who finds himself returning to the Hundred Acre Wood and reuniting with his old friends. Hayley Atwell co-stars in what may be Disney's most unique live-action follow-up to an animated film to date.

The Nutcracker and the Four Realms
The Nutcracker is a story familiar to millions of people, but the first trailers for The Nutcracker and the Four Realms shows that, as to be expected, the Disney version of the story will be something a little different. While the ballet that most people are familiar with will certainly be represented, what we've seen of the film shows that it will have almost Narnia like elements, as Clara won't simply dream of another world, but cross over into it, and travel to places that the ballet only references.

Ralph Breaks The Internet: Wreck-It Ralph 2
To date, only The Rescuers has seen a direct theatrical sequel to the original effort that was actually produced by Disney's main animation studio, but that changes in November 2018 when Wreck-It Ralph gets a big screen follow-up. The new film will see Ralph and Vanellope Von Schweetz leave the video game world behind in order to take on the entire internet. While many details are still unclear, we do know the movie will see all of Disney's popular princesses make an appearance together, making this one a must view for Disney fans.

Mary Poppins Returns
Of all the remakes and sequels, the single most daring thing Disney has on the horizon is likely Mary Poppins Returns. The film, which is being produced as a direct sequel to the 1960s original, has Emily Blunt take on the role of the practically perfect nanny which originally won Julie Andrews an Academy Award. While only time will tell if the sequel will be quite that good, it certainly looks like Mary Poppins Returns wants to be, as the cast includes the great Lin-Manuel Miranda and the film is directed by the Oscar-nominated director of Chicago.

Captain Marvel
While Captain Marvel is the big MCU movie set in between the two-part Avengers finale, it was set in the 1990s, predating most of the franchise. It introduced us to Brie Larson's new intergalactic hero, who promises to be a major part of Avengers: Endgame and beyond. It gave us a young Nick Fury and answered a couple of questions about the Marvel Cinematic Universe, while, of course, creating several more questions in the process.

Dumbo
The first of three big Disney live-action remakes to hit the screen in 2019 was Dumbo. The earliest Disney animated theatrical film to receive the live-action treatment, the story about the flying elephant was spearheaded by Tim Burton and told a significantly different story, which created a collection of human characters around the baby elephant. While many praised the CGI which created the title character, the rest of the film was not viewed as favorably by many.

Disney has had some of the biggest box office years of any studio in the history of time over the last few years. While the studio only has a handful of films planned for 2019, almost every single one of them is poised to be a major blockbuster. And then, of course, there's everything they have planned after that.

(window._jsqueue=window._jsqueue||[]).push("d3c8ab54-b5ca-47fe-9375-bbbeafbd3403");

Between all the different studios that Disney owns, and with another having recently joined them, there's a nearly endless stream of movies planned for the rest of this decade. Here is everything currently on the official Disney release calendar, animated, live-action, comic book, and science fiction, even a documentary just to balance things out. This is your one-stop shop for all things Disney. Here's everything that has to yet to be released by the House of Mouse.

Penguins
Release Date: April 12, 2019
Disney's next big release isn't likely to set pre-sale ticket records or smash the box office, but for a studio that has been in the documentary business almost as long as it's been in the animation business, it's nice that the studio still makes movies designed to educate even more than they're designed to entertain. You may not find this one easily at your major multiplex, but there's nothing wrong with seeking it out.

Avengers: Endgame
Release Date: April 26, 2019
It all comes down to this. After 22 films and 11 years the Marvel Cinematic Universe will come to a head with Avengers: Endgame. While the MCU will continue moving forward, we have no idea just what sort of shape it will be in. Who will live? Who will die? We certainly have no idea, and the only way to know for sure is to watch it and find out.

Aladdin
Release Date: May 24, 2019
Early looks at Aladdin had a lot of people worried. Whether it was Will Smith's Genie not being blue or the Genie being a little strange looking while being blue, fans of the animated original were less than thrilled. With the release of the first trailer, the fear seems to have largely calmed down. Considering how popular the original movie is, you can be sure Disney has high expectations for this one.

Toy Story 4
Release Date: June 21, 2019
Many would consider the first three Toy Story movies one of the finest trilogies in recent memory. The mere idea of a fourth film sends people into cold sweats, and yet, that film will be here soon. The story will see Woody reunited with his old flame Bo Peep as he and new friend Forky try to get back to Bonnie. The film appears to deal with questions of identity and purpose. There may be something left for this franchise to say after all.

Spider-Man: Far From Home (Sony Produced MCU Movie)
Release Date: July 5, 2019
Technically, Spider-Man: Far From Home isn't a Disney movie, but rather a Sony film. However, since it's still part of the marvel Cinematic Universe, and that's all Disney, we're going to include it here. Exactly how Spider-Man will make it from the end of Avengers: Infinity War to here we don't yet know, but however it works, it will see Peter Parker visiting Europe with school friends, where he'll be pressed into service by Nick Fury.

The Lion King
Release Date: July 19, 2019
The original Lion King is still one of the biggest hits Disney Animation has ever had. One can only imagine what will happen when the story returns to the screen via the same CGI/animation style that brought the animal of The Jungle Book to life. Donald Glover will voice Simba, Chiwetel Ejiofor will voice Scar, and James Earl Jones will be back to reprise his role as Mufasa. The last time this movie nearly made a billion dollars at the box office. This time that number might be low.

Artemis Fowl
Release Date: August 9, 2019
Artemis Fowl is based on a popular book series, but it's not exactly one on the level of Harry Potter. As such, it's hard to gauge how big this one will be. It could be a serious X-factor in the Disney schedule. If it hits as big as most of the movies on this list, it will almost certainly be the birth of a new franchise. If it doesn't it will likely be a footnote on an otherwise impressive box office year. We'll have to wait and see.

Maleficent: Mistress of Evil
After waiting years for the follow-up to the hit Maleficent Disney has decided not to waste any time. Originally set for a 2020 release, Maleficent: Mistress of Evil has been pushed up to the fall of 2019. It will be the first time we've seen Angelina Jolie in front of the camera in years. If she's as deliciously evil and fun as she was he first time around, this one will have been worth the wait.

Frozen II
Disney is going to be competing with itself for the box office crown this year. While it seems like Avengers: Endgame will be rthe movie to beat, one should not discount the possibility that Frozen II could play spoiler. The first movie is Disney's biggest animated hit ever and the love that many have for that movie still hasn't died down all these years later. The trailer for the sequel looks to take things down a darker path, but if it has even just one song to become the new "Let it Go," that could be all it needs to be another big hit.

Star Wars: Episode IX
Release Date: December 20, 2019
At the end of 2019, a trilogy many of us thought we'd never see will be coming to an end. The third Star Wars trilogy, will finally give a conclusion to the story of Rey, Finn, Poe, and our classic favorites from the original films. The Last Jedi was a movie that split fans. It will be interesting to see if the new film tries to unite them, or continues to carry Star Wars in to new and different places as the franchise continues to grow.

Beauty and the Beast
Disney's first step out of the gate in 2017 was a very high profile picture. Beauty and the Beast is quite possibly Disney's most beloved animated feature. As such, hopes -- and fears -- were running high with the live action version. It was the first live-action adaptation from Disney to be a full musical and while many loved hearing those songs again, for many the remake only reminded people how great the original was.

Born in China
While Disney built their reputation on animation, the studio has been making nature documentaries for almost as long. The latest of these, under the current Disneynature brand, was called Born in China. John Krasinski narrated this story of three animal families within the titular nation: giant pandas, golden monkeys, and snow leopards. While this film certainly didn't set the box office on fire, it was still as magical as anything Disney did in 2017.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2
The Guardians of the Galaxy movie became one of Marvel's biggest hits. The less-than-serious tone appealed to fans, and had them laughing as much as cheering. While the team was largely an unknown quantity the first time around, they had a lot to live up to with the sequel. For the most part, they succeeded. The film was a box office hit with a surprisingly poignant and emotional story.

Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales
The Pirates of the Caribbean movies started out great, and have been on a steady decline ever since. The newest entry, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales was a clear attempt to go back to the basics that made the first film work. With a new villain in Javier Bardem and the return of some classic characters, the film tried to recapture the magic. While the movie was a critical and box office flop, internationally the action adventure film still made hundreds of millions of dollars, which means the potential for more in this series is still out there.

Cars 3
Who'd have ever guessed that one of the most interesting films on the way from Pixar would be the third entry in the Cars franchise? A teaser trailer that promised the movie would open with a near-death experience from main character Lightning McQueen is the last thing we expected to see. Pixar promised a more grounded and emotional story than we saw in Cars 2. While we certainly got that, the third entry in the franchise didn't really do enough to wow critics or audiences.

Spider-Man: Homecoming
Spider-Man joined Marvel's cinematic universe in Captain America: Civil War. Now that he's back in the fold, Marvel is wasted no time in putting their new wall-crawler front and center - and fans embraced him with open arms. Technically Spider-Man: Homecoming was both marketed and distributed by Sony Pictures (part of the deal made a few years ago), but because of the Disney-owned Marvel Studios' involvement on the creative side, we're counting it here.

Thor: Ragnarok
Thor has never been the brightest star in the MCU. Having said that, there were a lot of eyes on Thor: Ragnarok. The addition of director Taika Waititi promised a significantly different tone than the previous films. We certainly got that. Ragnarok was a much funnier and more thrilling version of the Asgardian than we had seen before. The film outdid all of Thor's previous outings at the box office and set him up nicely for the coming Infinity War.

Coco
Coco is Pixar's lone original story on its current slate, surrounded on all sides by sequels. The story followed a young boy named Miguel with a passion for music. That music opened a door to the land of the dead, and sent Miguel on a journey that reunited him with lost family members. Coco was everything that we expect from Pixar, a studio who knows how to make their stories resonate with audiences. It's too early to tell if this is one of Pixar's all-time great films, but it certainly made the argument.

Star Wars: The Last Jedi
Disney's 2017 ended in the same place that the previous couple years wrapped up, Star Wars. The middle episode of the current trilogy was helmed by Looper's Rian Johnson and while opinions on the film, on the whole, have been mixed, you can't argue that Johnson didn't get people talking. Some called The Last Jedi the best Star Wars movie ever, while others called it the worst. However you feel, it's clear that the franchise will never be the same again.

Black Panther
Black Panther made his MCU debut in Captain America: Civil War and the character has the spotlight all to himself before Marvel's big crossover event begins later in the year. This will be the earliest in the year that we've seen a Marvel movie debut, but with the stacked calendar that Disney has this year, there was really no other place to put it. Expect Black Panther to set the table for Avengers: Infinity War coming later in the year. It will also set the tone for Disney's likely utter domination of the 2018 box office.

A Wrinkle In Time
Expectations are fairly high for Disney's big screen version of the popular novel A Wrinkle in Time. The great Ava DuVernay is directing the adaptation and it includes the likes of Oprah Winfrey, Mindy Kaling, Reese Witherspoon and Chris Pine. The trailers have shown the film to be everything that decades worth of fans of the book will likely want to see, with strange alien worlds and equally strange characters. While this movie has the potential to get buried underneath all the massive franchises, its fanbase is so potentially huge that if it breaks out, it could be one of the biggest movies of the year.

Avengers: Infinity War
What is there to say about the Marvel Cinematic Universe that hasn't already been said? It's celebrating its tenth anniversary in 2018, and to celebrate, it's starting the two-part event that is Avengers: Infinity War. We'll see virtually every character that the MCU has introduced in one place in what promises to be the biggest spectacle of the year. Infinity War is already looking like the film to beat at the box office in 2018. It seems unlikely any other movie is up to the challenge.

Solo: A Star Wars Story
Three weeks after Disney drops it's biggest Marvel movie in years, it will bring out the next entry in their other major franchise, Star Wars. Solo: A Star Wars Story will be the first of the new generation of Star Wars films to see a summer release; this despite the film seeing significant delays due to the directors being replaced in the middle of filming. Nobody is quite sure what to expect from the new movie that stars Alden Ehrenreich as the young smuggler, but it's Star Wars so you can be sure it will be big.

The Incredibles 2
Following on the success of Coco, Pixar will fall back on another familiar property and do what every other studio has done, make a sequel to a popular superhero movie. Of course, this is Pixar, so you can be sure that what we get will still be something special. The Incredibles was one of the best superhero movies ever made in the era before the MCU was a thing, and fans have certainly wanted to see a sequel to the superfamily drama. Indications are that Holly Hunter's Elastigirl will be taking center stage in the new film.

Ant-Man and the Wasp
Nobody knew quite what to expect when Ant-Man joined the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but what we got was a surprisingly fun, and funny, entry in the franchise. We know even less about how the sequel will work seeing as it's situated between the two Avengers films, but we know that Evangeline Lily will be donning her own costume as the Wasp and the movie will deal with an attempt to rescue Janet Van Dyne from the Quantum Realm.

Christopher Robin
Disney's last live-action remake was Beauty and the Beast and it was the top movie at the box office for most of 2017. Christopher Robin isn't a remake so much as it is a sort of sequel that will see Ewan McGregor as a grown-up Christopher Robin who finds himself returning to the Hundred Acre Wood and reuniting with his old friends. Hayley Atwell co-stars in what may be Disney's most unique live-action follow-up to an animated film to date.

The Nutcracker and the Four Realms
The Nutcracker is a story familiar to millions of people, but the first trailers for The Nutcracker and the Four Realms shows that, as to be expected, the Disney version of the story will be something a little different. While the ballet that most people are familiar with will certainly be represented, what we've seen of the film shows that it will have almost Narnia like elements, as Clara won't simply dream of another world, but cross over into it, and travel to places that the ballet only references.

Ralph Breaks The Internet: Wreck-It Ralph 2
To date, only The Rescuers has seen a direct theatrical sequel to the original effort that was actually produced by Disney's main animation studio, but that changes in November 2018 when Wreck-It Ralph gets a big screen follow-up. The new film will see Ralph and Vanellope Von Schweetz leave the video game world behind in order to take on the entire internet. While many details are still unclear, we do know the movie will see all of Disney's popular princesses make an appearance together, making this one a must view for Disney fans.

Mary Poppins Returns
Of all the remakes and sequels, the single most daring thing Disney has on the horizon is likely Mary Poppins Returns. The film, which is being produced as a direct sequel to the 1960s original, has Emily Blunt take on the role of the practically perfect nanny which originally won Julie Andrews an Academy Award. While only time will tell if the sequel will be quite that good, it certainly looks like Mary Poppins Returns wants to be, as the cast includes the great Lin-Manuel Miranda and the film is directed by the Oscar-nominated director of Chicago.

Captain Marvel
While Captain Marvel is the big MCU movie set in between the two-part Avengers finale, it was set in the 1990s, predating most of the franchise. It introduced us to Brie Larson's new intergalactic hero, who promises to be a major part of Avengers: Endgame and beyond. It gave us a young Nick Fury and answered a couple of questions about the Marvel Cinematic Universe, while, of course, creating several more questions in the process.

Dumbo
The first of three big Disney live-action remakes to hit the screen in 2019 was Dumbo. The earliest Disney animated theatrical film to receive the live-action treatment, the story about the flying elephant was spearheaded by Tim Burton and told a significantly different story, which created a collection of human characters around the baby elephant. While many praised the CGI which created the title character, the rest of the film was not viewed as favorably by many.

Disney has had some of the biggest box office years of any studio in the history of time over the last few years. While the studio only has a handful of films planned for 2019, almost every single one of them is poised to be a major blockbuster. And then, of course, there's everything they have planned after that.

Between all the different studios that Disney owns, and with another having recently joined them, there's a nearly endless stream of movies planned for the rest of this decade. Here is everything currently on the official Disney release calendar, animated, live-action, comic book, and science fiction, even a documentary just to balance things out. This is your one-stop shop for all things Disney. Here's everything that has to yet to be released by the House of Mouse.

Disney's next big release isn't likely to set pre-sale ticket records or smash the box office, but for a studio that has been in the documentary business almost as long as it's been in the animation business, it's nice that the studio still makes movies designed to educate even more than they're designed to entertain. You may not find this one easily at your major multiplex, but there's nothing wrong with seeking it out.

Aladdin
Release Date: May 24, 2019
Early looks at Aladdin had a lot of people worried. Whether it was Will Smith's Genie not being blue or the Genie being a little strange looking while being blue, fans of the animated original were less than thrilled. With the release of the first trailer, the fear seems to have largely calmed down. Considering how popular the original movie is, you can be sure Disney has high expectations for this one.

Toy Story 4
Release Date: June 21, 2019
Many would consider the first three Toy Story movies one of the finest trilogies in recent memory. The mere idea of a fourth film sends people into cold sweats, and yet, that film will be here soon. The story will see Woody reunited with his old flame Bo Peep as he and new friend Forky try to get back to Bonnie. The film appears to deal with questions of identity and purpose. There may be something left for this franchise to say after all.

Spider-Man: Far From Home (Sony Produced MCU Movie)
Release Date: July 5, 2019
Technically, Spider-Man: Far From Home isn't a Disney movie, but rather a Sony film. However, since it's still part of the marvel Cinematic Universe, and that's all Disney, we're going to include it here. Exactly how Spider-Man will make it from the end of Avengers: Infinity War to here we don't yet know, but however it works, it will see Peter Parker visiting Europe with school friends, where he'll be pressed into service by Nick Fury.

The Lion King
Release Date: July 19, 2019
The original Lion King is still one of the biggest hits Disney Animation has ever had. One can only imagine what will happen when the story returns to the screen via the same CGI/animation style that brought the animal of The Jungle Book to life. Donald Glover will voice Simba, Chiwetel Ejiofor will voice Scar, and James Earl Jones will be back to reprise his role as Mufasa. The last time this movie nearly made a billion dollars at the box office. This time that number might be low.

Artemis Fowl
Release Date: August 9, 2019
Artemis Fowl is based on a popular book series, but it's not exactly one on the level of Harry Potter. As such, it's hard to gauge how big this one will be. It could be a serious X-factor in the Disney schedule. If it hits as big as most of the movies on this list, it will almost certainly be the birth of a new franchise. If it doesn't it will likely be a footnote on an otherwise impressive box office year. We'll have to wait and see.

Maleficent: Mistress of Evil
After waiting years for the follow-up to the hit Maleficent Disney has decided not to waste any time. Originally set for a 2020 release, Maleficent: Mistress of Evil has been pushed up to the fall of 2019. It will be the first time we've seen Angelina Jolie in front of the camera in years. If she's as deliciously evil and fun as she was he first time around, this one will have been worth the wait.

Frozen II
Disney is going to be competing with itself for the box office crown this year. While it seems like Avengers: Endgame will be rthe movie to beat, one should not discount the possibility that Frozen II could play spoiler. The first movie is Disney's biggest animated hit ever and the love that many have for that movie still hasn't died down all these years later. The trailer for the sequel looks to take things down a darker path, but if it has even just one song to become the new "Let it Go," that could be all it needs to be another big hit.

Star Wars: Episode IX
Release Date: December 20, 2019
At the end of 2019, a trilogy many of us thought we'd never see will be coming to an end. The third Star Wars trilogy, will finally give a conclusion to the story of Rey, Finn, Poe, and our classic favorites from the original films. The Last Jedi was a movie that split fans. It will be interesting to see if the new film tries to unite them, or continues to carry Star Wars in to new and different places as the franchise continues to grow.

Beauty and the Beast
Disney's first step out of the gate in 2017 was a very high profile picture. Beauty and the Beast is quite possibly Disney's most beloved animated feature. As such, hopes -- and fears -- were running high with the live action version. It was the first live-action adaptation from Disney to be a full musical and while many loved hearing those songs again, for many the remake only reminded people how great the original was.

Born in China
While Disney built their reputation on animation, the studio has been making nature documentaries for almost as long. The latest of these, under the current Disneynature brand, was called Born in China. John Krasinski narrated this story of three animal families within the titular nation: giant pandas, golden monkeys, and snow leopards. While this film certainly didn't set the box office on fire, it was still as magical as anything Disney did in 2017.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2
The Guardians of the Galaxy movie became one of Marvel's biggest hits. The less-than-serious tone appealed to fans, and had them laughing as much as cheering. While the team was largely an unknown quantity the first time around, they had a lot to live up to with the sequel. For the most part, they succeeded. The film was a box office hit with a surprisingly poignant and emotional story.

Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales
The Pirates of the Caribbean movies started out great, and have been on a steady decline ever since. The newest entry, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales was a clear attempt to go back to the basics that made the first film work. With a new villain in Javier Bardem and the return of some classic characters, the film tried to recapture the magic. While the movie was a critical and box office flop, internationally the action adventure film still made hundreds of millions of dollars, which means the potential for more in this series is still out there.

Cars 3
Who'd have ever guessed that one of the most interesting films on the way from Pixar would be the third entry in the Cars franchise? A teaser trailer that promised the movie would open with a near-death experience from main character Lightning McQueen is the last thing we expected to see. Pixar promised a more grounded and emotional story than we saw in Cars 2. While we certainly got that, the third entry in the franchise didn't really do enough to wow critics or audiences.

Spider-Man: Homecoming
Spider-Man joined Marvel's cinematic universe in Captain America: Civil War. Now that he's back in the fold, Marvel is wasted no time in putting their new wall-crawler front and center - and fans embraced him with open arms.

Thor: Ragnarok
Thor has never been the brightest star in the MCU. Having said that, there were a lot of eyes on Thor: Ragnarok. The addition of director Taika Waititi promised a significantly different tone than the previous films. We certainly got that. Ragnarok was a much funnier and more thrilling version of the Asgardian than we had seen before. The film outdid all of Thor's previous outings at the box office and set him up nicely for the coming Infinity War.

Coco
Coco is Pixar's lone original story on its current slate, surrounded on all sides by sequels. The story followed a young boy named Miguel with a passion for music. That music opened a door to the land of the dead, and sent Miguel on a journey that reunited him with lost family members. Coco was everything that we expect from Pixar, a studio who knows how to make their stories resonate with audiences. It's too early to tell if this is one of Pixar's all-time great films, but it certainly made the argument.

Star Wars: The Last Jedi
Disney's 2017 ended in the same place that the previous couple years wrapped up, Star Wars. The middle episode of the current trilogy was helmed by Looper's Rian Johnson and while opinions on the film, on the whole, have been mixed, you can't argue that Johnson didn't get people talking. Some called The Last Jedi the best Star Wars movie ever, while others called it the worst. However you feel, it's clear that the franchise will never be the same again.

Black Panther
Black Panther made his MCU debut in Captain America: Civil War and the character has the spotlight all to himself before Marvel's big crossover event begins later in the year. This will be the earliest in the year that we've seen a Marvel movie debut, but with the stacked calendar that Disney has this year, there was really no other place to put it. Expect Black Panther to set the table for Avengers: Infinity War coming later in the year. It will also set the tone for Disney's likely utter domination of the 2018 box office.

A Wrinkle In Time
Expectations are fairly high for Disney's big screen version of the popular novel A Wrinkle in Time. The great Ava DuVernay is directing the adaptation and it includes the likes of Oprah Winfrey, Mindy Kaling, Reese Witherspoon and Chris Pine. The trailers have shown the film to be everything that decades worth of fans of the book will likely want to see, with strange alien worlds and equally strange characters. While this movie has the potential to get buried underneath all the massive franchises, its fanbase is so potentially huge that if it breaks out, it could be one of the biggest movies of the year.

Avengers: Infinity War
What is there to say about the Marvel Cinematic Universe that hasn't already been said? It's celebrating its tenth anniversary in 2018, and to celebrate, it's starting the two-part event that is Avengers: Infinity War. We'll see virtually every character that the MCU has introduced in one place in what promises to be the biggest spectacle of the year. Infinity War is already looking like the film to beat at the box office in 2018. It seems unlikely any other movie is up to the challenge.

Solo: A Star Wars Story
Three weeks after Disney drops it's biggest Marvel movie in years, it will bring out the next entry in their other major franchise, Star Wars. Solo: A Star Wars Story will be the first of the new generation of Star Wars films to see a summer release; this despite the film seeing significant delays due to the directors being replaced in the middle of filming. Nobody is quite sure what to expect from the new movie that stars Alden Ehrenreich as the young smuggler, but it's Star Wars so you can be sure it will be big.

The Incredibles 2
Following on the success of Coco, Pixar will fall back on another familiar property and do what every other studio has done, make a sequel to a popular superhero movie. Of course, this is Pixar, so you can be sure that what we get will still be something special. The Incredibles was one of the best superhero movies ever made in the era before the MCU was a thing, and fans have certainly wanted to see a sequel to the superfamily drama. Indications are that Holly Hunter's Elastigirl will be taking center stage in the new film.

Christopher Robin
Disney's last live-action remake was Beauty and the Beast and it was the top movie at the box office for most of 2017. Christopher Robin isn't a remake so much as it is a sort of sequel that will see Ewan McGregor as a grown-up Christopher Robin who finds himself returning to the Hundred Acre Wood and reuniting with his old friends. Hayley Atwell co-stars in what may be Disney's most unique live-action follow-up to an animated film to date.

The Nutcracker and the Four Realms
The Nutcracker is a story familiar to millions of people, but the first trailers for The Nutcracker and the Four Realms shows that, as to be expected, the Disney version of the story will be something a little different. While the ballet that most people are familiar with will certainly be represented, what we've seen of the film shows that it will have almost Narnia like elements, as Clara won't simply dream of another world, but cross over into it, and travel to places that the ballet only references.

Ralph Breaks The Internet: Wreck-It Ralph 2
To date, only The Rescuers has seen a direct theatrical sequel to the original effort that was actually produced by Disney's main animation studio, but that changes in November 2018 when Wreck-It Ralph gets a big screen follow-up. The new film will see Ralph and Vanellope Von Schweetz leave the video game world behind in order to take on the entire internet. While many details are still unclear, we do know the movie will see all of Disney's popular princesses make an appearance together, making this one a must view for Disney fans.

Mary Poppins Returns
Of all the remakes and sequels, the single most daring thing Disney has on the horizon is likely Mary Poppins Returns. The film, which is being produced as a direct sequel to the 1960s original, has Emily Blunt take on the role of the practically perfect nanny which originally won Julie Andrews an Academy Award. While only time will tell if the sequel will be quite that good, it certainly looks like Mary Poppins Returns wants to be, as the cast includes the great Lin-Manuel Miranda and the film is directed by the Oscar-nominated director of Chicago.

Captain Marvel
While Captain Marvel is the big MCU movie set in between the two-part Avengers finale, it was set in the 1990s, predating most of the franchise. It introduced us to Brie Larson's new intergalactic hero, who promises to be a major part of Avengers: Endgame and beyond. It gave us a young Nick Fury and answered a couple of questions about the Marvel Cinematic Universe, while, of course, creating several more questions in the process.

Dumbo
The first of three big Disney live-action remakes to hit the screen in 2019 was Dumbo. The earliest Disney animated theatrical film to receive the live-action treatment, the story about the flying elephant was spearheaded by Tim Burton and told a significantly different story, which created a collection of human characters around the baby elephant. While many praised the CGI which created the title character, the rest of the film was not viewed as favorably by many.

Disney has had some of the biggest box office years of any studio in the history of time over the last few years. While the studio only has a handful of films planned for 2019, almost every single one of them is poised to be a major blockbuster. And then, of course, there's everything they have planned after that.

(window._jsqueue=window._jsqueue||[]).push("d3c8ab54-b5ca-47fe-9375-bbbeafbd3403");

Between all the different studios that Disney owns, and with another having recently joined them, there's a nearly endless stream of movies planned for the rest of this decade. Here is everything currently on the official Disney release calendar, animated, live-action, comic book, and science fiction, even a documentary just to balance things out. This is your one-stop shop for all things Disney. Here's everything that has to yet to be released by the House of Mouse.

Penguins
Release Date: April 12, 2019
Disney's next big release isn't likely to set pre-sale ticket records or smash the box office, but for a studio that has been in the documentary business almost as long as it's been in the animation business, it's nice that the studio still makes movies designed to educate even more than they're designed to entertain. You may not find this one easily at your major multiplex, but there's nothing wrong with seeking it out.

Avengers: Endgame
Release Date: April 26, 2019
It all comes down to this. After 22 films and 11 years the Marvel Cinematic Universe will come to a head with Avengers: Endgame. While the MCU will continue moving forward, we have no idea just what sort of shape it will be in. Who will live? Who will die? We certainly have no idea, and the only way to know for sure is to watch it and find out.

Aladdin
Release Date: May 24, 2019
Early looks at Aladdin had a lot of people worried. Whether it was Will Smith's Genie not being blue or the Genie being a little strange looking while being blue, fans of the animated original were less than thrilled. With the release of the first trailer, the fear seems to have largely calmed down. Considering how popular the original movie is, you can be sure Disney has high expectations for this one.

Toy Story 4
Release Date: June 21, 2019
Many would consider the first three Toy Story movies one of the finest trilogies in recent memory. The mere idea of a fourth film sends people into cold sweats, and yet, that film will be here soon. The story will see Woody reunited with his old flame Bo Peep as he and new friend Forky try to get back to Bonnie. The film appears to deal with questions of identity and purpose. There may be something left for this franchise to say after all.

Spider-Man: Far From Home (Sony Produced MCU Movie)
Release Date: July 5, 2019
Technically, Spider-Man: Far From Home isn't a Disney movie, but rather a Sony film. However, since it's still part of the marvel Cinematic Universe, and that's all Disney, we're going to include it here. Exactly how Spider-Man will make it from the end of Avengers: Infinity War to here we don't yet know, but however it works, it will see Peter Parker visiting Europe with school friends, where he'll be pressed into service by Nick Fury.

The Lion King
Release Date: July 19, 2019
The original Lion King is still one of the biggest hits Disney Animation has ever had. One can only imagine what will happen when the story returns to the screen via the same CGI/animation style that brought the animal of The Jungle Book to life. Donald Glover will voice Simba, Chiwetel Ejiofor will voice Scar, and James Earl Jones will be back to reprise his role as Mufasa. The last time this movie nearly made a billion dollars at the box office. This time that number might be low.

Artemis Fowl
Release Date: August 9, 2019
Artemis Fowl is based on a popular book series, but it's not exactly one on the level of Harry Potter. As such, it's hard to gauge how big this one will be. It could be a serious X-factor in the Disney schedule. If it hits as big as most of the movies on this list, it will almost certainly be the birth of a new franchise. If it doesn't it will likely be a footnote on an otherwise impressive box office year. We'll have to wait and see.

Maleficent: Mistress of Evil
After waiting years for the follow-up to the hit Maleficent Disney has decided not to waste any time. Originally set for a 2020 release, Maleficent: Mistress of Evil has been pushed up to the fall of 2019. It will be the first time we've seen Angelina Jolie in front of the camera in years. If she's as deliciously evil and fun as she was he first time around, this one will have been worth the wait.

Frozen II
Disney is going to be competing with itself for the box office crown this year. While it seems like Avengers: Endgame will be rthe movie to beat, one should not discount the possibility that Frozen II could play spoiler. The first movie is Disney's biggest animated hit ever and the love that many have for that movie still hasn't died down all these years later. The trailer for the sequel looks to take things down a darker path, but if it has even just one song to become the new "Let it Go," that could be all it needs to be another big hit.

Star Wars: Episode IX
Release Date: December 20, 2019
At the end of 2019, a trilogy many of us thought we'd never see will be coming to an end. The third Star Wars trilogy, will finally give a conclusion to the story of Rey, Finn, Poe, and our classic favorites from the original films. The Last Jedi was a movie that split fans. It will be interesting to see if the new film tries to unite them, or continues to carry Star Wars in to new and different places as the franchise continues to grow.

Beauty and the Beast
Disney's first step out of the gate in 2017 was a very high profile picture. Beauty and the Beast is quite possibly Disney's most beloved animated feature. As such, hopes -- and fears -- were running high with the live action version. It was the first live-action adaptation from Disney to be a full musical and while many loved hearing those songs again, for many the remake only reminded people how great the original was.

Born in China
While Disney built their reputation on animation, the studio has been making nature documentaries for almost as long. The latest of these, under the current Disneynature brand, was called Born in China. John Krasinski narrated this story of three animal families within the titular nation: giant pandas, golden monkeys, and snow leopards. While this film certainly didn't set the box office on fire, it was still as magical as anything Disney did in 2017.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2
The Guardians of the Galaxy movie became one of Marvel's biggest hits. The less-than-serious tone appealed to fans, and had them laughing as much as cheering. While the team was largely an unknown quantity the first time around, they had a lot to live up to with the sequel. For the most part, they succeeded. The film was a box office hit with a surprisingly poignant and emotional story.

Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales
The Pirates of the Caribbean movies started out great, and have been on a steady decline ever since. The newest entry, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales was a clear attempt to go back to the basics that made the first film work. With a new villain in Javier Bardem and the return of some classic characters, the film tried to recapture the magic. While the movie was a critical and box office flop, internationally the action adventure film still made hundreds of millions of dollars, which means the potential for more in this series is still out there.

Cars 3
Who'd have ever guessed that one of the most interesting films on the way from Pixar would be the third entry in the Cars franchise? A teaser trailer that promised the movie would open with a near-death experience from main character Lightning McQueen is the last thing we expected to see. Pixar promised a more grounded and emotional story than we saw in Cars 2. While we certainly got that, the third entry in the franchise didn't really do enough to wow critics or audiences.

Spider-Man: Homecoming
Spider-Man joined Marvel's cinematic universe in Captain America: Civil War. Now that he's back in the fold, Marvel is wasted no time in putting their new wall-crawler front and center - and fans embraced him with open arms. Technically Spider-Man: Homecoming was both marketed and distributed by Sony Pictures (part of the deal made a few years ago), but because of the Disney-owned Marvel Studios' involvement on the creative side, we're counting it here.

Thor: Ragnarok
Thor has never been the brightest star in the MCU. Having said that, there were a lot of eyes on Thor: Ragnarok. The addition of director Taika Waititi promised a significantly different tone than the previous films. We certainly got that. Ragnarok was a much funnier and more thrilling version of the Asgardian than we had seen before. The film outdid all of Thor's previous outings at the box office and set him up nicely for the coming Infinity War.

Coco
Coco is Pixar's lone original story on its current slate, surrounded on all sides by sequels. The story followed a young boy named Miguel with a passion for music. That music opened a door to the land of the dead, and sent Miguel on a journey that reunited him with lost family members. Coco was everything that we expect from Pixar, a studio who knows how to make their stories resonate with audiences. It's too early to tell if this is one of Pixar's all-time great films, but it certainly made the argument.

Star Wars: The Last Jedi
Disney's 2017 ended in the same place that the previous couple years wrapped up, Star Wars. The middle episode of the current trilogy was helmed by Looper's Rian Johnson and while opinions on the film, on the whole, have been mixed, you can't argue that Johnson didn't get people talking. Some called The Last Jedi the best Star Wars movie ever, while others called it the worst. However you feel, it's clear that the franchise will never be the same again.

Black Panther
Black Panther made his MCU debut in Captain America: Civil War and the character has the spotlight all to himself before Marvel's big crossover event begins later in the year. This will be the earliest in the year that we've seen a Marvel movie debut, but with the stacked calendar that Disney has this year, there was really no other place to put it. Expect Black Panther to set the table for Avengers: Infinity War coming later in the year. It will also set the tone for Disney's likely utter domination of the 2018 box office.

A Wrinkle In Time
Expectations are fairly high for Disney's big screen version of the popular novel A Wrinkle in Time. The great Ava DuVernay is directing the adaptation and it includes the likes of Oprah Winfrey, Mindy Kaling, Reese Witherspoon and Chris Pine. The trailers have shown the film to be everything that decades worth of fans of the book will likely want to see, with strange alien worlds and equally strange characters. While this movie has the potential to get buried underneath all the massive franchises, its fanbase is so potentially huge that if it breaks out, it could be one of the biggest movies of the year.

Avengers: Infinity War
What is there to say about the Marvel Cinematic Universe that hasn't already been said? It's celebrating its tenth anniversary in 2018, and to celebrate, it's starting the two-part event that is Avengers: Infinity War. We'll see virtually every character that the MCU has introduced in one place in what promises to be the biggest spectacle of the year. Infinity War is already looking like the film to beat at the box office in 2018. It seems unlikely any other movie is up to the challenge.

Solo: A Star Wars Story
Three weeks after Disney drops it's biggest Marvel movie in years, it will bring out the next entry in their other major franchise, Star Wars. Solo: A Star Wars Story will be the first of the new generation of Star Wars films to see a summer release; this despite the film seeing significant delays due to the directors being replaced in the middle of filming. Nobody is quite sure what to expect from the new movie that stars Alden Ehrenreich as the young smuggler, but it's Star Wars so you can be sure it will be big.

The Incredibles 2
Following on the success of Coco, Pixar will fall back on another familiar property and do what every other studio has done, make a sequel to a popular superhero movie. Of course, this is Pixar, so you can be sure that what we get will still be something special. The Incredibles was one of the best superhero movies ever made in the era before the MCU was a thing, and fans have certainly wanted to see a sequel to the superfamily drama. Indications are that Holly Hunter's Elastigirl will be taking center stage in the new film.

Ant-Man and the Wasp
Nobody knew quite what to expect when Ant-Man joined the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but what we got was a surprisingly fun, and funny, entry in the franchise. We know even less about how the sequel will work seeing as it's situated between the two Avengers films, but we know that Evangeline Lily will be donning her own costume as the Wasp and the movie will deal with an attempt to rescue Janet Van Dyne from the Quantum Realm.

Christopher Robin
Disney's last live-action remake was Beauty and the Beast and it was the top movie at the box office for most of 2017. Christopher Robin isn't a remake so much as it is a sort of sequel that will see Ewan McGregor as a grown-up Christopher Robin who finds himself returning to the Hundred Acre Wood and reuniting with his old friends. Hayley Atwell co-stars in what may be Disney's most unique live-action follow-up to an animated film to date.

The Nutcracker and the Four Realms
The Nutcracker is a story familiar to millions of people, but the first trailers for The Nutcracker and the Four Realms shows that, as to be expected, the Disney version of the story will be something a little different. While the ballet that most people are familiar with will certainly be represented, what we've seen of the film shows that it will have almost Narnia like elements, as Clara won't simply dream of another world, but cross over into it, and travel to places that the ballet only references.

Ralph Breaks The Internet: Wreck-It Ralph 2
To date, only The Rescuers has seen a direct theatrical sequel to the original effort that was actually produced by Disney's main animation studio, but that changes in November 2018 when Wreck-It Ralph gets a big screen follow-up. The new film will see Ralph and Vanellope Von Schweetz leave the video game world behind in order to take on the entire internet. While many details are still unclear, we do know the movie will see all of Disney's popular princesses make an appearance together, making this one a must view for Disney fans.

Mary Poppins Returns
Of all the remakes and sequels, the single most daring thing Disney has on the horizon is likely Mary Poppins Returns. The film, which is being produced as a direct sequel to the 1960s original, has Emily Blunt take on the role of the practically perfect nanny which originally won Julie Andrews an Academy Award. While only time will tell if the sequel will be quite that good, it certainly looks like Mary Poppins Returns wants to be, as the cast includes the great Lin-Manuel Miranda and the film is directed by the Oscar-nominated director of Chicago.

Captain Marvel
While Captain Marvel is the big MCU movie set in between the two-part Avengers finale, it was set in the 1990s, predating most of the franchise. It introduced us to Brie Larson's new intergalactic hero, who promises to be a major part of Avengers: Endgame and beyond. It gave us a young Nick Fury and answered a couple of questions about the Marvel Cinematic Universe, while, of course, creating several more questions in the process.

Dumbo
The first of three big Disney live-action remakes to hit the screen in 2019 was Dumbo. The earliest Disney animated theatrical film to receive the live-action treatment, the story about the flying elephant was spearheaded by Tim Burton and told a significantly different story, which created a collection of human characters around the baby elephant. While many praised the CGI which created the title character, the rest of the film was not viewed as favorably by many.

Disney has had some of the biggest box office years of any studio in the history of time over the last few years. While the studio only has a handful of films planned for 2019, almost every single one of them is poised to be a major blockbuster. And then, of course, there's everything they have planned after that.

(window._jsqueue=window._jsqueue||[]).push("d3c8ab54-b5ca-47fe-9375-bbbeafbd3403");

Between all the different studios that Disney owns, and with another having recently joined them, there's a nearly endless stream of movies planned for the rest of this decade. Here is everything currently on the official Disney release calendar, animated, live-action, comic book, and science fiction, even a documentary just to balance things out. This is your one-stop shop for all things Disney. Here's everything that has to yet to be released by the House of Mouse.

Penguins
Release Date: April 12, 2019
Disney's next big release isn't likely to set pre-sale ticket records or smash the box office, but for a studio that has been in the documentary business almost as long as it's been in the animation business, it's nice that the studio still makes movies designed to educate even more than they're designed to entertain.

Avengers: Endgame
Release Date: April 26, 2019
It all comes down to this. After 22 films and 11 years the Marvel Cinematic Universe will come to a head with Avengers: Endgame. While the MCU will continue moving forward, we have no idea just what sort of shape it will be in. Who will live? Who will die? We certainly have no idea, and the only way to know for sure is to watch it and find out.

Aladdin
Release Date: May 24, 2019
Early looks at Aladdin had a lot of people worried. Whether it was Will Smith's Genie not being blue or the Genie being a little strange looking while being blue, fans of the animated original were less than thrilled. With the release of the first trailer, the fear seems to have largely calmed down. Considering how popular the original movie is, you can be sure Disney has high expectations for this one.

Toy Story 4
Release Date: June 21, 2019
Many would consider the first three Toy Story movies one of the finest trilogies in recent memory. The mere idea of a fourth film sends people into cold sweats, and yet, that film will be here soon. The story will see Woody reunited with his old flame Bo Peep as he and new friend Forky try to get back to Bonnie. The film appears to deal with questions of identity and purpose. There may be something left for this franchise to say after all.

Spider-Man: Far From Home (Sony Produced MCU Movie)
Release Date: July 5, 2019
Technically, Spider-Man: Far From Home isn't a Disney movie, but rather a Sony film. However, since it's still part of the marvel Cinematic Universe, and that's all Disney, we're going to include it here. Exactly how Spider-Man will make it from the end of Avengers: Infinity War to here we don't yet know, but however it works, it will see Peter Parker visiting Europe with school friends, where he'll be pressed into service by Nick Fury.

The Lion King
Release Date: July 19, 2019
The original Lion King is still one of the biggest hits Disney Animation has ever had. One can only imagine what will happen when the story returns to the screen via the same CGI/animation style that brought the animal of The Jungle Book to life. Donald Glover will voice Simba, Chiwetel Ejiofor will voice Scar, and James Earl Jones will be back to reprise his role as Mufasa. The last time this movie nearly made a billion dollars at the box office. This time that number might be low.

Artemis Fowl
Release Date: August 9, 2019
Artemis Fowl is based on a popular book series, but it's not exactly one on the level of Harry Potter. As such, it's hard to gauge how big this one will be. It could be a serious X-factor in the Disney schedule. If it hits as big as most of the movies on this list, it will almost certainly be the birth of a new franchise. If it doesn't it will likely be a footnote on an otherwise impressive box office year. We'll have to wait and see.

Maleficent: Mistress of Evil
After waiting years for the follow-up to the hit Maleficent Disney has decided not to waste any time. Originally set for a 2020 release, Maleficent: Mistress of Evil has been pushed up to the fall of 2019. It will be the first time we've seen Angelina Jolie in front of the camera in years. If she's as deliciously evil and fun as she was he first time around, this one will have been worth the wait.

Frozen II
Disney is going to be competing with itself for the box office crown this year. While it seems like Avengers: Endgame will be rthe movie to beat, one should not discount the possibility that Frozen II could play spoiler. The first movie is Disney's biggest animated hit ever and the love that many have for that movie still hasn't died down all these years later. The trailer for the sequel looks to take things down a darker path, but if it has even just one song to become the new "Let it Go," that could be all it needs to be another big hit.

Star Wars: Episode IX
Release Date: December 20, 2019
At the end of 2019, a trilogy many of us thought we'd never see will be coming to an end. The third Star Wars trilogy, will finally give a conclusion to the story of Rey, Finn, Poe, and our classic favorites from the original films. The Last Jedi was a movie that split fans. It will be interesting to see if the new film tries to unite them, or continues to carry Star Wars in to new and different places as the franchise continues to grow.

Beauty and the Beast
Disney's first step out of the gate in 2017 was a very high profile picture. Beauty and the Beast is quite possibly Disney's most beloved animated feature. As such, hopes -- and fears -- were running high with the live action version. It was the first live-action adaptation from Disney to be a full musical and while many loved hearing those songs again, for many the remake only reminded people how great the original was.

Born in China
While Disney built their reputation on animation, the studio has been making nature documentaries for almost as long. The latest of these, under the current Disneynature brand, was called Born in China. John Krasinski narrated this story of three animal families within the titular nation: giant pandas, golden monkeys, and snow leopards. While this film certainly didn't set the box office on fire, it was still as magical as anything Disney did in 2017.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2
The Guardians of the Galaxy movie became one of Marvel's biggest hits. The less-than-serious tone appealed to fans, and had them laughing as much as cheering. While the team was largely an unknown quantity the first time around, they had a lot to live up to with the sequel. For the most part, they succeeded. The film was a box office hit with a surprisingly poignant and emotional story.

Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales
The Pirates of the Caribbean movies started out great, and have been on a steady decline ever since. The newest entry, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales was a clear attempt to go back to the basics that made the first film work. With a new villain in Javier Bardem and the return of some classic characters, the film tried to recapture the magic. While the movie was a critical and box office flop, internationally the action adventure film still made hundreds of millions of dollars, which means the potential for more in this series is still out there.

Cars 3
Who'd have ever guessed that one of the most interesting films on the way from Pixar would be the third entry in the Cars franchise? A teaser trailer that promised the movie would open with a near-death experience from main character Lightning McQueen is the last thing we expected to see. Pixar promised a more grounded and emotional story than we saw in Cars 2. While we certainly got that, the third entry in the franchise didn't really do enough to wow critics or audiences.

Spider-Man: Homecoming
Spider-Man joined Marvel's cinematic universe in Captain America: Civil War. Now that he's back in the fold, Marvel is wasted no time in putting their new wall-crawler front and center - and fans embraced him with open arms.

Thor: Ragnarok
Thor has never been the brightest star in the MCU. Having said that, there were a lot of eyes on Thor: Ragnarok. The addition of director Taika Waititi promised a significantly different tone than the previous films. We certainly got that. Ragnarok was a much funnier and more thrilling version of the Asgardian than we had seen before. The film outdid all of Thor's previous outings at the box office and set him up nicely for the coming Infinity War.

Coco
Coco is Pixar's lone original story on its current slate, surrounded on all sides by sequels. The story followed a young boy named Miguel with a passion for music. That music opened a door to the land of the dead, and sent Miguel on a journey that reunited him with lost family members. Coco was everything that we expect from Pixar, a studio who knows how to make their stories resonate with audiences. It's too early to tell if this is one of Pixar's all-time great films, but it certainly made the argument.

Star Wars: The Last Jedi
Disney's 2017 ended in the same place that the previous couple years wrapped up, Star Wars. The middle episode of the current trilogy was helmed by Looper's Rian Johnson and while opinions on the film, on the whole, have been mixed, you can't argue that Johnson didn't get people talking. Some called The Last Jedi the best Star Wars movie ever, while others called it the worst. However you feel, it's clear that the franchise will never be the same again.

Black Panther
Black Panther made his MCU debut in Captain America: Civil War and the character has the spotlight all to himself before Marvel's big crossover event begins later in the year. This will be the earliest in the year that we've seen a Marvel movie debut, but with the stacked calendar that Disney has this year, there was really no other place to put it. Expect Black Panther to set the table for Avengers: Infinity War coming later in the year. It will also set the tone for Disney's likely utter domination of the 2018 box office.

A Wrinkle In Time
Expectations are fairly high for Disney's big screen version of the popular novel A Wrinkle in Time. The great Ava DuVernay is directing the adaptation and it includes the likes of Oprah Winfrey, Mindy Kaling, Reese Witherspoon and Chris Pine. The trailers have shown the film to be everything that decades worth of fans of the book will likely want to see, with strange alien worlds and equally strange characters. While this movie has the potential to get buried underneath all the massive franchises, its fanbase is so potentially huge that if it breaks out, it could be one of the biggest movies of the year.

Avengers: Infinity War
What is there to say about the Marvel Cinematic Universe that hasn't already been said? It's celebrating its tenth anniversary in 2018, and to celebrate, it's starting the two-part event that is Avengers: Infinity War. We'll see virtually every character that the MCU has introduced in one place in what promises to be the biggest spectacle of the year. Infinity War is already looking like the film to beat at the box office in 2018. It seems unlikely any other movie is up to the challenge.

Solo: A Star Wars Story
Three weeks after Disney drops it's biggest Marvel movie in years, it will bring out the next entry in their other major franchise, Star Wars. Solo: A Star Wars Story will be the first of the new generation of Star Wars films to see a summer release; this despite the film seeing significant delays due to the directors being replaced in the middle of filming. Nobody is quite sure what to expect from the new movie that stars Alden Ehrenreich as the young smuggler, but it's Star Wars so you can be sure it will be big.

The Incredibles 2
Following on the success of Coco, Pixar will fall back on another familiar property and do what every other studio has done, make a sequel to a popular superhero movie. Of course, this is Pixar, so you can be sure that what we get will still be something special. The Incredibles was one of the best superhero movies ever made in the era before the MCU was a thing, and fans have certainly wanted to see a sequel to the superfamily drama. Indications are that Holly Hunter's Elastigirl will be taking center stage in the new film.

We know even less about how the sequel will work seeing as it's situated between the two Avengers films, but we know that Evangeline Lily will be donning her own costume as the Wasp and the movie will deal with an attempt to rescue Janet Van Dyne from the Quantum Realm.

Christopher Robin
Disney's last live-action remake was Beauty and the Beast and it was the top movie at the box office for most of 2017. Christopher Robin isn't a remake so much as it is a sort of sequel that will see Ewan McGregor as a grown-up Christopher Robin who finds himself returning to the Hundred Acre Wood and reuniting with his old friends. Hayley Atwell co-stars in what may be Disney's most unique live-action follow-up to an animated film to date.

The Nutcracker and the Four Realms
The Nutcracker is a story familiar to millions of people, but the first trailers for The Nutcracker and the Four Realms shows that, as to be expected, the Disney version of the story will be something a little different. While the ballet that most people are familiar with will certainly be represented, what we've seen of the film shows that it will have almost Narnia like elements, as Clara won't simply dream of another world, but cross over into it, and travel to places that the ballet only references.

Ralph Breaks The Internet: Wreck-It Ralph 2
To date, only The Rescuers has seen a direct theatrical sequel to the original effort that was actually produced by Disney's main animation studio, but that changes in November 2018 when Wreck-It Ralph gets a big screen follow-up. The new film will see Ralph and Vanellope Von Schweetz leave the video game world behind in order to take on the entire internet. While many details are still unclear, we do know the movie will see all of Disney's popular princesses make an appearance together, making this one a must view for Disney fans.

Mary Poppins Returns
Of all the remakes and sequels, the single most daring thing Disney has on the horizon is likely Mary Poppins Returns. The film, which is being produced as a direct sequel to the 1960s original, has Emily Blunt take on the role of the practically perfect nanny which originally won Julie Andrews an Academy Award. While only time will tell if the sequel will be quite that good, it certainly looks like Mary Poppins Returns wants to be, as the cast includes the great Lin-Manuel Miranda and the film is directed by the Oscar-nominated director of Chicago.

Captain Marvel
While Captain Marvel is the big MCU movie set in between the two-part Avengers finale, it was set in the 1990s, predating most of the franchise. It introduced us to Brie Larson's new intergalactic hero, who promises to be a major part of Avengers: Endgame and beyond. It gave us a young Nick Fury and answered a couple of questions about the Marvel Cinematic Universe, while, of course, creating several more questions in the process.

Dumbo
The first of three big Disney live-action remakes to hit the screen in 2019 was Dumbo. The earliest Disney animated theatrical film to receive the live-action treatment, the story about the flying elephant was spearheaded by Tim Burton and told a significantly different story, which created a collection of human characters around the baby elephant. While many praised the CGI which created the title character, the rest of the film was not viewed as favorably by many.

Disney has had some of the biggest box office years of any studio in the history of time over the last few years. While the studio only has a handful of films planned for 2019, almost every single one of them is poised to be a major blockbuster. And then, of course, there's everything they have planned after that.

Penguins
Release Date: April 12, 2019
Disney's next big release isn't likely to set pre-sale ticket records or smash the box office, but for a studio that has been in the documentary business almost as long as it's been in the animation business, it's nice that the studio still makes movies designed to educate even more than they're designed to entertain. You may not find this one easily at your major multiplex, but there's nothing wrong with seeking it out.

Avengers: Endgame
Release Date: April 26, 2019
It all comes down to this. After 22 films and 11 years the Marvel Cinematic Universe will come to a head with Avengers: Endgame. While the MCU will continue moving forward, we have no idea just what sort of shape it will be in. Who will live? Who will die? We certainly have no idea, and the only way to know for sure is to watch it and find out.

Aladdin
Release Date: May 24, 2019
Early looks at Aladdin had a lot of people worried. Whether it was Will Smith's Genie not being blue or the Genie being a little strange looking while being blue, fans of the animated original were less than thrilled. With the release of the first trailer, the fear seems to have largely calmed down. Considering how popular the original movie is, you can be sure Disney has high expectations for this one.

Toy Story 4
Release Date: June 21, 2019
Many would consider the first three Toy Story movies one of the finest trilogies in recent memory. The mere idea of a fourth film sends people into cold sweats, and yet, that film will be here soon. The story will see Woody reunited with his old flame Bo Peep as he and new friend Forky try to get back to Bonnie. The film appears to deal with questions of identity and purpose. There may be something left for this franchise to say after all.

Spider-Man: Far From Home (Sony Produced MCU Movie)
Release Date: July 5, 2019
Technically, Spider-Man: Far From Home isn't a Disney movie, but rather a Sony film. However, since it's still part of the marvel Cinematic Universe, and that's all Disney, we're going to include it here. Exactly how Spider-Man will make it from the end of Avengers: Infinity War to here we don't yet know, but however it works, it will see Peter Parker visiting Europe with school friends, where he'll be pressed into service by Nick Fury.

The Lion King
Release Date: July 19, 2019
The original Lion King is still one of the biggest hits Disney Animation has ever had. One can only imagine what will happen when the story returns to the screen via the same CGI/animation style that brought the animal of The Jungle Book to life. Donald Glover will voice Simba, Chiwetel Ejiofor will voice Scar, and James Earl Jones will be back to reprise his role as Mufasa. The last time this movie nearly made a billion dollars at the box office. This time that number might be low.

Artemis Fowl
Release Date: August 9, 2019
Artemis Fowl is based on a popular book series, but it's not exactly one on the level of Harry Potter. As such, it's hard to gauge how big this one will be. It could be a serious X-factor in the Disney schedule. If it hits as big as most of the movies on this list, it will almost certainly be the birth of a new franchise. If it doesn't it will likely be a footnote on an otherwise impressive box office year. We'll have to wait and see.

Maleficent: Mistress of Evil
After waiting years for the follow-up to the hit Maleficent Disney has decided not to waste any time. Originally set for a 2020 release, Maleficent: Mistress of Evil has been pushed up to the fall of 2019. It will be the first time we've seen Angelina Jolie in front of the camera in years. If she's as deliciously evil and fun as she was he first time around, this one will have been worth the wait.

Frozen II
Disney is going to be competing with itself for the box office crown this year. While it seems like Avengers: Endgame will be rthe movie to beat, one should not discount the possibility that Frozen II could play spoiler. The first movie is Disney's biggest animated hit ever and the love that many have for that movie still hasn't died down all these years later. The trailer for the sequel looks to take things down a darker path, but if it has even just one song to become the new "Let it Go," that could be all it needs to be another big hit.

The third Star Wars trilogy, will finally give a conclusion to the story of Rey, Finn, Poe, and our classic favorites from the original films. The Last Jedi was a movie that split fans. It will be interesting to see if the new film tries to unite them, or continues to carry Star Wars in to new and different places as the franchise continues to grow.

Beauty and the Beast
Disney's first step out of the gate in 2017 was a very high profile picture. Beauty and the Beast is quite possibly Disney's most beloved animated feature. As such, hopes -- and fears -- were running high with the live action version. It was the first live-action adaptation from Disney to be a full musical and while many loved hearing those songs again, for many the remake only reminded people how great the original was.

Born in China
While Disney built their reputation on animation, the studio has been making nature documentaries for almost as long. The latest of these, under the current Disneynature brand, was called Born in China. John Krasinski narrated this story of three animal families within the titular nation: giant pandas, golden monkeys, and snow leopards. While this film certainly didn't set the box office on fire, it was still as magical as anything Disney did in 2017.

John Krasinski narrated this story of three animal families within the titular nation: giant pandas, golden monkeys, and snow leopards. While this film certainly didn't set the box office on fire, it was still as magical as anything Disney did in 2017.
Release Date: April 21, 2017
 


Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2
The Guardians of the Galaxy movie became one of Marvel's biggest hits. The less-than-serious tone appealed to fans, and had them laughing as much as cheering. While the team was largely an unknown quantity the first time around, they had a lot to live up to with the sequel. For the most part, they succeeded. The film was a box office hit with a surprisingly poignant and emotional story.

Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales
The Pirates of the Caribbean movies started out great, and have been on a steady decline ever since. The newest entry, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales was a clear attempt to go back to the basics that made the first film work. With a new villain in Javier Bardem and the return of some classic characters, the film tried to recapture the magic. While the movie was a critical and box office flop, internationally the action adventure film still made hundreds of millions of dollars, which means the potential for more in this series is still out there.

Cars 3
Who'd have ever guessed that one of the most interesting films on the way from Pixar would be the third entry in the Cars franchise? A teaser trailer that promised the movie would open with a near-death experience from main character Lightning McQueen is the last thing we expected to see. Pixar promised a more grounded and emotional story than we saw in Cars 2. While we certainly got that, the third entry in the franchise didn't really do enough to wow critics or audiences.

Spider-Man: Homecoming
Spider-Man joined Marvel's cinematic universe in Captain America: Civil War. Now that he's back in the fold, Marvel is wasted no time in putting their new wall-crawler front and center - and fans embraced him with open arms. Technically Spider-Man: Homecoming was both marketed and distributed by Sony Pictures (part of the deal made a few years ago), but because of the Disney-owned Marvel Studios' involvement on the creative side, we're counting it here.

Thor: Ragnarok
Thor has never been the brightest star in the MCU. Having said that, there were a lot of eyes on Thor: Ragnarok. The addition of director Taika Waititi promised a significantly different tone than the previous films. We certainly got that. Ragnarok was a much funnier and more thrilling version of the Asgardian than we had seen before. The film outdid all of Thor's previous outings at the box office and set him up nicely for the coming Infinity War.

Coco
Coco is Pixar's lone original story on its current slate, surrounded on all sides by sequels. The story followed a young boy named Miguel with a passion for music. That music opened a door to the land of the dead, and sent Miguel on a journey that reunited him with lost family members. Coco was everything that we expect from Pixar, a studio who knows how to make their stories resonate with audiences. It's too early to tell if this is one of Pixar's all-time great films, but it certainly made the argument.

Star Wars: The Last Jedi
Disney's 2017 ended in the same place that the previous couple years wrapped up, Star Wars. The middle episode of the current trilogy was helmed by Looper's Rian Johnson and while opinions on the film, on the whole, have been mixed, you can't argue that Johnson didn't get people talking. Some called The Last Jedi the best Star Wars movie ever, while others called it the worst. However you feel, it's clear that the franchise will never be the same again.

Black Panther
Black Panther made his MCU debut in Captain America: Civil War and the character has the spotlight all to himself before Marvel's big crossover event begins later in the year. This will be the earliest in the year that we've seen a Marvel movie debut, but with the stacked calendar that Disney has this year, there was really no other place to put it. Expect Black Panther to set the table for Avengers: Infinity War coming later in the year. It will also set the tone for Disney's likely utter domination of the 2018 box office.

A Wrinkle In Time
Expectations are fairly high for Disney's big screen version of the popular novel A Wrinkle in Time. The great Ava DuVernay is directing the adaptation and it includes the likes of Oprah Winfrey, Mindy Kaling, Reese Witherspoon and Chris Pine. The trailers have shown the film to be everything that decades worth of fans of the book will likely want to see, with strange alien worlds and equally strange characters. While this movie has the potential to get buried underneath all the massive franchises, its fanbase is so potentially huge that if it breaks out, it could be one of the biggest movies of the year.

Avengers: Infinity War
What is there to say about the Marvel Cinematic Universe that hasn't already been said? It's celebrating its tenth anniversary in 2018, and to celebrate, it's starting the two-part event that is Avengers: Infinity War. We'll see virtually every character that the MCU has introduced in one place in what promises to be the biggest spectacle of the year. Infinity War is already looking like the film to beat at the box office in 2018. It seems unlikely any other movie is up to the challenge.

Solo: A Star Wars Story
Three weeks after Disney drops it's biggest Marvel movie in years, it will bring out the next entry in their other major franchise, Star Wars. Solo: A Star Wars Story will be the first of the new generation of Star Wars films to see a summer release; this despite the film seeing significant delays due to the directors being replaced in the middle of filming. Nobody is quite sure what to expect from the new movie that stars Alden Ehrenreich as the young smuggler, but it's Star Wars so you can be sure it will be big.

The Incredibles 2
Following on the success of Coco, Pixar will fall back on another familiar property and do what every other studio has done, make a sequel to a popular superhero movie. Of course, this is Pixar, so you can be sure that what we get will still be something special. The Incredibles was one of the best superhero movies ever made in the era before the MCU was a thing, and fans have certainly wanted to see a sequel to the superfamily drama. Indications are that Holly Hunter's Elastigirl will be taking center stage in the new film.

Ant-Man and the Wasp
Nobody knew quite what to expect when Ant-Man joined the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but what we got was a surprisingly fun, and funny, entry in the franchise. We know even less about how the sequel will work seeing as it's situated between the two Avengers films, but we know that Evangeline Lily will be donning her own costume as the Wasp and the movie will deal with an attempt to rescue Janet Van Dyne from the Quantum Realm.

Christopher Robin
Disney's last live-action remake was Beauty and the Beast and it was the top movie at the box office for most of 2017. Christopher Robin isn't a remake so much as it is a sort of sequel that will see Ewan McGregor as a grown-up Christopher Robin who finds himself returning to the Hundred Acre Wood and reuniting with his old friends. Hayley Atwell co-stars in what may be Disney's most unique live-action follow-up to an animated film to date.

The Nutcracker and the Four Realms
The Nutcracker is a story familiar to millions of people, but the first trailers for The Nutcracker and the Four Realms shows that, as to be expected, the Disney version of the story will be something a little different. While the ballet that most people are familiar with will certainly be represented, what we've seen of the film shows that it will have almost Narnia like elements, as Clara won't simply dream of another world, but cross over into it, and travel to places that the ballet only references.

Ralph Breaks The Internet: Wreck-It Ralph 2
To date, only The Rescuers has seen a direct theatrical sequel to the original effort that was actually produced by Disney's main animation studio, but that changes in November 2018 when Wreck-It Ralph gets a big screen follow-up. The new film will see Ralph and Vanellope Von Schweetz leave the video game world behind in order to take on the entire internet. While many details are still unclear, we do know the movie will see all of Disney's popular princesses make an appearance together, making this one a must view for Disney fans.

Mary Poppins Returns
Of all the remakes and sequels, the single most daring thing Disney has on the horizon is likely Mary Poppins Returns. The film, which is being produced as a direct sequel to the 1960s original, has Emily Blunt take on the role of the practically perfect nanny which originally won Julie Andrews an Academy Award. While only time will tell if the sequel will be quite that good, it certainly looks like Mary Poppins Returns wants to be, as the cast includes the great Lin-Manuel Miranda and the film is directed by the Oscar-nominated director of Chicago.

Captain Marvel
While Captain Marvel is the big MCU movie set in between the two-part Avengers finale, it was set in the 1990s, predating most of the franchise. It introduced us to Brie Larson's new intergalactic hero, who promises to be a major part of Avengers: Endgame and beyond. It gave us a young Nick Fury and answered a couple of questions about the Marvel Cinematic Universe, while, of course, creating several more questions in the process.

Dumbo
The first of three big Disney live-action remakes to hit the screen in 2019 was Dumbo. The earliest Disney animated theatrical film to receive the live-action treatment, the story about the flying elephant was spearheaded by Tim Burton and told a significantly different story, which created a collection of human characters around the baby elephant. While many praised the CGI which created the title character, the rest of the film was not viewed as favorably by many.
