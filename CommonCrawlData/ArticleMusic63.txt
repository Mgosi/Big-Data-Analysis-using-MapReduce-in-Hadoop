3Ball MTY during their surprise appearance at the Billboard Latin Music Conference (Arnold Turner)

Electronic trio 3BallMTY is loading up their second album with newer sounds, more percussion and the kinds of guest collaborations from U.S. artists that their debut, "Intentalo," left off.
"Electronic music has been growing at a rapid pace, getting even more electronic… and we're trying to follow that road," the Mexican group told us at the Billboard Latin Music Conference on Tuesday. "We have many guest DJs from the United States [and] are working with a producer who has worked with many important artists. He has been pushing us to succeed."
Who is this notable producer? The collective, comprised of Erick Rincon, DJ Otto and Sheeqo Beat, isn't saying. But they do hint that the album will be "debuting soon."
"There are many collaborations with so many artists. And our sound is different. Not too different, it's still very much in line with who 3BallMTY is."
The trio just played Coachella, where they were "accepted with open arms," and will be in Miami on Thursday to attend the Billboard Latin Music Awards.
3BallMTY is up for eight nods at the BLMAs, including Artist of the Year, New and Albums Artist of the Year, Duo or Group. "Intentalo" competes for Regional Mexican Album of the Year, while the song by the same name, a collaboration with El Bebeto and America Sierra, vies for Song of the Year, among other awards.

Who is this notable producer? The collective, comprised of Erick Rincon, DJ Otto and Sheeqo Beat, isn't saying. But they do hint that the album will be "debuting soon."
"There are many collaborations with so many artists. And our sound is different. Not too different, it's still very much in line with who 3BallMTY is."
The trio just played Coachella, where they were "accepted with open arms," and will be in Miami on Thursday to attend the Billboard Latin Music Awards.
3BallMTY is up for eight nods at the BLMAs, including Artist of the Year, New and Albums Artist of the Year, Duo or Group. "Intentalo" competes for Regional Mexican Album of the Year, while the song by the same name, a collaboration with El Bebeto and America Sierra, vies for Song of the Year, among other awards.

Electronic trio 3BallMTY is loading up their second album with newer sounds, more percussion and the kinds of guest collaborations from U.S. artists that their debut, "Intentalo," left off.
"Electronic music has been growing at a rapid pace, getting even more electronic… and we're trying to follow that road," the Mexican group told us at the Billboard Latin Music Conference on Tuesday. "We have many guest DJs from the United States [and] are working with a producer who has worked with many important artists. He has been pushing us to succeed."
