Another Book Art Gift from Edinburgh’s Mystery Paper Sculptor



O happy day! We reported a year and a half ago that it looked as though the marvelous and mysterious paper book sculptures that had been opping up all over Edinburgh were at an end. Now it appears that may not be the case after all, as another has appeared, this time at Leith Library. The new discovery, rather than being Ian Rankin-themed (as its predecessors), is an homage to A.A. Milne’s beloved bear Winnie-the-Pooh. 
The artist has called the work “Preparing to Fly”, and it depicts a beautiful birds’ nest atop a book. Poking out of the nest are three small, hungry bird mouths stretching skyward in anticipation of food. The accompanying Milne quote reads:
“It is more fun to talk with someone who doesn’t use long, difficult words but rather short, easy words like ‘What about lunch?’”
The anonymous (and wishing to remain that way) sculptor has revealed very little about herself – only that she is indeed a woman, and that the sculptures are gifts for what she considers to be special places.
