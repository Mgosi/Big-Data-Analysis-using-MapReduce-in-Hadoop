LANCO dropped their new single “Rival” today (March 21). An anthemic track about forgetting the haters, “Rival” has already proved to be a hit with fans in the group’s live show.   With thumping beats, soaring guitar riffs and a sing-along chorus, “Rival” is the first taste of new music from the band’s upcoming sophomore album. “Ever since I was young/ I carved my own path/ You can go and make fun/ Imma get the last laugh/ I’m on top of the world now/ If you don’t like it you can shut your mouth,” they croon on the track.The track was written by frontman Brandon Lancaster and drummer Tripp Howell, and produced by Jay Joyce (Eric Church, Brothers Osborne).“There's so much pressure to be like someone else or to live up to some outside expectation, especially with social media and how perfect it makes everything look,” Lancaster says in a statement. “We wrote this song from the perspective of no matter where you come from, be proud of who you are and the way you’re creating your own path. And if anyone doesn’t like it, just chalk them up as a rival and keep doing your thing.”

“We realized that everyone has faced something they have to stand up against. It isn’t about fitting into any mold, it’s about sticking up for what you believe in and having that crew of friends around that will always have your back,” Howell adds. “That’s definitely a big part of our story. We didn’t know anything or anyone when we started out trying to break into this business, and I think that underdog mentality really drove us in the beginning.”  “Rival” follows LANCO’s previous two singles, “Born to Love You” and “Greatest Love Story,” both featured on their 2018 debut album Hallelujah Nights. They are currently on the road as part of Luke Combs’ Beer Never Broke My Heart Tour.The online extension of Billboard Magazine, billboard.biz is the essential online destination for the music business.Learn More© 2019 Billboard.
