By Thessaly La ForceOctober 1, 2009In 1967, two architects named Norval White and Elliot Willensky published the “AIA Guide to New York City,” the first guidebook to the city’s buildings. The book was a door-stopper, featuring over twenty-six hundred buildings in four hundred and sixty-four pages. It proceeded block by block, documenting not only a building’s facade (“Boldly scaled Art Nouveau; Terra-cotta Eclectic”) but the history of its inhabitants (“Edwin Booth, brother of Lincoln’s assassin John Wilkes, lived at 16 Gramercy Park South”). Reading it is a joy, and one immediately sees how anyone—the feverish real-estate broker, the stunned tourist, or the pontificating college historian—would love it. Since its initial publication, the guide has been updated three times (the current edition weights 2.9 pounds, and is now over a thousand pages long). This coming spring, the fifth, even more expansive edition, will be published by Oxford University Press.Last week, Francis Leadon, a Professor of Architecture at the City College of New York, and some of his students were standing in front of 555 Hudson Street, photographing the final building to be included in the guide. Leadon is the book’s newest co-author (Willensky died in 1990; White is eighty-four and lives in France), and he has spent the past year (with the aide of his students), photographing some seven thousand buildings that are to be added to the fifth edition. “It’s a very humble building,” Leadon said. “It doesn’t have a really cool cornice, it wasn’t built by a famous architect. It was probably built in the early nineteenth century by a carpenter. It’s an example of an anonymous building—the kind of building that makes up much of New York.”Why save this one for last? Because 555 Hudson Street also happens to have been the home of Jane Jacobs, the famous urbanist, activist, and author. She lived there from the late forties to the late sixties, and it was here that she penned “The Death and Life of Great American Cities.” In it, she writes:The stretch of Hudson Street where I live is each day the scene of an intricate sidewalk ballet. I make my own first entrance into it a little after eight when I put out the garbage can, surely a prosaic occupation, but I enjoy my part, my little clang, as the droves of junior high students walk by the center of the stage dropping candy wrappers. (How do they eat so much candy so early in the morning?)Of course, not all of “Death and Life” is about candy wrappers and the satisfying clang of a garbage-can lid. It was primarily a critique of the nineteen-fifties urban renewal policies espoused by Robert Moses, New York City’s “master-builder.” But Leadon is clear in stating that the AIA guide doesn’t take sides. “It certainly includes all the Robert Moses projects,” he said. “But I think it is in important to finish up with Jane Jacobs. Without her, I don’t think neighborhoods would be as cohesive as hers is. I am making a point about what is most important to me: neighborhoods.”Afterward, Leadon and his students celebrated by heading over to Magnolia for cupcakes. And who lives in 555 Hudson now? “It’s actually for sale!” Leadon said. “We were talking about getting together and buying it. It could be the new AIA headquarters or something.”(Photographs courtesy of Francis Leadon)Dive into the world of literature with The New Yorker’s weekly fiction newsletter.By Ben TaubBy Mike SpiesBy Susan B.

Since its initial publication, the guide has been updated three times (the current edition weights 2.9 pounds, and is now over a thousand pages long). This coming spring, the fifth, even more expansive edition, will be published by Oxford University Press.Last week, Francis Leadon, a Professor of Architecture at the City College of New York, and some of his students were standing in front of 555 Hudson Street, photographing the final building to be included in the guide. Leadon is the book’s newest co-author (Willensky died in 1990; White is eighty-four and lives in France), and he has spent the past year (with the aide of his students), photographing some seven thousand buildings that are to be added to the fifth edition. “It’s a very humble building,” Leadon said. “It doesn’t have a really cool cornice, it wasn’t built by a famous architect. It was probably built in the early nineteenth century by a carpenter. It’s an example of an anonymous building—the kind of building that makes up much of New York.”Why save this one for last? Because 555 Hudson Street also happens to have been the home of Jane Jacobs, the famous urbanist, activist, and author. She lived there from the late forties to the late sixties, and it was here that she penned “The Death and Life of Great American Cities.” In it, she writes:The stretch of Hudson Street where I live is each day the scene of an intricate sidewalk ballet. I make my own first entrance into it a little after eight when I put out the garbage can, surely a prosaic occupation, but I enjoy my part, my little clang, as the droves of junior high students walk by the center of the stage dropping candy wrappers. (How do they eat so much candy so early in the morning?)Of course, not all of “Death and Life” is about candy wrappers and the satisfying clang of a garbage-can lid. It was primarily a critique of the nineteen-fifties urban renewal policies espoused by Robert Moses, New York City’s “master-builder.” But Leadon is clear in stating that the AIA guide doesn’t take sides. “It certainly includes all the Robert Moses projects,” he said. “But I think it is in important to finish up with Jane Jacobs. Without her, I don’t think neighborhoods would be as cohesive as hers is. I am making a point about what is most important to me: neighborhoods.”Afterward, Leadon and his students celebrated by heading over to Magnolia for cupcakes. And who lives in 555 Hudson now? “It’s actually for sale!” Leadon said. “We were talking about getting together and buying it. It could be the new AIA headquarters or something.”(Photographs courtesy of Francis Leadon)In 1967, two architects named Norval White and Elliot Willensky published the “AIA Guide to New York City,” the first guidebook to the city’s buildings. The book was a door-stopper, featuring over twenty-six hundred buildings in four hundred and sixty-four pages. It proceeded block by block, documenting not only a building’s facade (“Boldly scaled Art Nouveau; Terra-cotta Eclectic”) but the history of its inhabitants (“Edwin Booth, brother of Lincoln’s assassin John Wilkes, lived at 16 Gramercy Park South”). Reading it is a joy, and one immediately sees how anyone—the feverish real-estate broker, the stunned tourist, or the pontificating college historian—would love it.
