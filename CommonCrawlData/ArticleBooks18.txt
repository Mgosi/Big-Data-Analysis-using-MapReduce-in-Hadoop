By Carolyn KormannSeptember 3, 2015Bernie Krause likens the single-species paradigm in biodiversity recordings to “trying to understand the magnificence of Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony by abstracting the sound of a single violin.”Since 1968, Bernie Krause, a seventy-six-year-old musician, writer, and self-described “soundscape ecologist,” has visited every continent, often carrying cumbersome and heavy equipment. His mission: to record Earth’s remaining tracts of wilderness and their inhabitants. His enormous archive—much of it captured on seven-inch reels of quarter-inch-wide audiotape—contains the sounds made by more than fifteen thousand species, and more than five thousand hours of “holistic habitat,” or the entire synchronous soundscape, from insects and birds to bellowing orangutans. And yet, as Krause recounts in his slender new book, “Voices of the Wild: Animal Songs, Human Din, and the Call to Save Natural Soundscapes,” more than half of his audio data “comes from sites [now] so badly compromised by various forms of human intervention that the habitats are either altogether silent or the soundscapes can no longer be heard in any of their original forms.” His collection is an auditory Library of Alexandria for everything nonhuman.Listen here to one of Krause’s soundscape recordings, featuring an orangutan, among many other species:Krause, who once played guitar for the Weavers, Pete Seeger’s popular folk band, had a long career as a studio musician, pioneering the use of the Moog synthesizer in film and pop music. (If you know where to listen, you can hear his work in “Apocalypse Now” and “Love Story.”) His growing obsession with natural soundscapes carried him out of the commercial entertainment world—and led eventually to commissions from museums, zoos, aquariums, arts groups, orchestras, even a ballet company and a TED talk (yellow-colored glasses, purple shirt, hiking sneakers). His work has been hailed by E. O. Wilson and Jane Goodall. When he’s not in Borneo or Rwanda, he lives with his wife, Katherine, in the California wine country, where they run an organization called Wild Sanctuary.Krause’s 2012 book, “The Great Animal Orchestra,” includes descriptions of some of the animal music he has discovered: a honking sea anemone, a beaver’s eerie keening after a human killed his mate. His new book surveys the broad field of bioacoustics, “the study of the sounds living animals produce.” Until recently, most scientists who went into the field to record animals tried to isolate individual species’ sounds. Ornithologists are largely responsible for this model—they made some of the earliest field recordings, pushing to develop technology that could capture an individual bird’s call removed from its larger environmental context. Cornell University’s Macaulay Library describes itself as “the world’s largest and oldest scientific archive of biodiversity audio and video recordings,” yet there are only bird species on its “Audio Most Wanted” list (masked duck, red-faced cormorant). Krause, however, is interested in a given habitat’s entire soundscape—its “biophony”—and finds the single-species paradigm absurd. He writes that it’s “like trying to understand the magnificence of Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony by abstracting the sound of a single violin player out of the context of the orchestra and hearing only that one part.”He and others have developed a hypothesis: that each living organism in a biome evolves in situ to find its own acoustic niche, based either on frequency or time, so that “their utterances are not buried by other signals.” Thus, each animal sound, plus the sounds of the wind in the trees, or waves on a beach, fit together like pieces of a puzzle to create the kaleidoscopic composition we hear. According to this theory, animals change their sounds when their habitat changes. Krause cites a study that found killer whales, for instance, will alter their vocalizations to accommodate the presence of boat noise.Krause wants more scientists to monitor the health of ecosystems by regularly recording the collective sounds of a particular habitat, generating “solid baseline data to use in comparing site changes over time.” He himself repeatedly recorded a forest site in California’s Sierra Nevada for more than twenty-five years. In 1988, the site was subjected to “selective logging,” which, according to the timber company doing the logging, would have no environmental impact. Yet Krause’s tapes of the post-logging years sound like a weak middle-school jazz band playing where there had once been the New York Philharmonic. The forest looked relatively healthy and unchanged. Tracking natural soundscapes over time, Krause argues, can uncover levels of habitat degradation that aren’t visually apparent. Baseline biophonies can also be used “to articulate the effects of climate change.”“Voices of the Wild” reads like an extended introduction to work and research that has yet to be done. Krause calls for better methods of statistically measuring how human din (“anthropophony”) affects natural soundscapes. For the most part, his and his colleagues’ work hasn’t proven sufficient to push back against mining, timber, and fossil-fuel companies that want to develop wild lands, or groups that want to increase motorized access in national parks. In one case, though, Krause and others were able to demonstrate that snowmobile noise in Yellowstone National Park had a negative impact on wildlife and humans alike, which led the federal government to restrict access.Humans evolved while relying on the soundscapes of forests and plains to hunt, navigate, and find refuge. Krause wants more people to seek out natural sounds and learn (or remember) how to listen. Recent studies of the effects of human din (such as automobile and aircraft traffic) have found that it can cause depression, high stress levels, insomnia, and headaches. It has even been linked to lowered I.Q. scores among children. On the other hand, some studies suggest that “the emotional consequences of natural soundscapes on urban-living humans may have a huge positive effect on our sense of well-being.” Krause cites a common Japanese preventative health-care practice, scientifically shown to have robust mental and physical benefits, known as Shinrin-yoku_,_ or “forest bathing.”Krause reminds me of someone who is mentioned in the novel “Dept. of Speculation,” by Jenny Offill. The narrator of that book describes a “man who travels around the world trying to find places where you can stand still and hear no human sound.” She goes on, “It is impossible to feel calm in cities, he believes, because we so rarely hear birdsong there. Our ears evolved to be our warning systems. We are on high alert in places where no birds sing.”One morning, on a walk in the Colorado Rockies, I learned that I have lost that particular ancient warning system. It was just after sunrise, and I was walking with a friend’s dog, Mojo, along a canyon trail. A mule deer suddenly leapt across our path. I was startled, but delighted. I should have noticed that the birds had stopped singing. A few seconds passed. Then came the roar.I had never heard a sound like it. Mojo froze, then bolted down the hill. I sprinted after him. A year and a half later, my friends in Colorado e-mailed me a video. They had set up a camera trap to see if they could get footage of the big predator terrorizing the canyon. (One man had found his pet Chihuahuas’ heads. Just the heads.) I saw a grainy, shadowy image of the familiar, aspen-lined trail. Then, slinking across the frame, a pale mountain lion appeared, svelte and magnificent.I wish I had a recording of that roar; I wonder if I will ever hear another sound like it. I was happy when, not long ago, I heard that a fresh elk carcass had been found back in the canyon. The mountain lion was still there, padding across the red-clay outcrops, roaring at whatever might interrupt her breakfast.Carolyn Kormann is a staff writer at The New Yorker.Dive into the world of literature with The New Yorker’s weekly fiction newsletter.By Ben TaubBy Mike SpiesBy Susan B.

Recent studies of the effects of human din (such as automobile and aircraft traffic) have found that it can cause depression, high stress levels, insomnia, and headaches. It has even been linked to lowered I.Q. scores among children. On the other hand, some studies suggest that “the emotional consequences of natural soundscapes on urban-living humans may have a huge positive effect on our sense of well-being.” Krause cites a common Japanese preventative health-care practice, scientifically shown to have robust mental and physical benefits, known as Shinrin-yoku_,_ or “forest bathing.”Krause reminds me of someone who is mentioned in the novel “Dept. of Speculation,” by Jenny Offill. The narrator of that book describes a “man who travels around the world trying to find places where you can stand still and hear no human sound.” She goes on, “It is impossible to feel calm in cities, he believes, because we so rarely hear birdsong there. Our ears evolved to be our warning systems. We are on high alert in places where no birds sing.”One morning, on a walk in the Colorado Rockies, I learned that I have lost that particular ancient warning system. It was just after sunrise, and I was walking with a friend’s dog, Mojo, along a canyon trail. A mule deer suddenly leapt across our path. I was startled, but delighted. I should have noticed that the birds had stopped singing. A few seconds passed. Then came the roar.I had never heard a sound like it. Mojo froze, then bolted down the hill. I sprinted after him. A year and a half later, my friends in Colorado e-mailed me a video. They had set up a camera trap to see if they could get footage of the big predator terrorizing the canyon. (One man had found his pet Chihuahuas’ heads. Just the heads.) I saw a grainy, shadowy image of the familiar, aspen-lined trail. Then, slinking across the frame, a pale mountain lion appeared, svelte and magnificent.I wish I had a recording of that roar; I wonder if I will ever hear another sound like it. I was happy when, not long ago, I heard that a fresh elk carcass had been found back in the canyon. The mountain lion was still there, padding across the red-clay outcrops, roaring at whatever might interrupt her breakfast.Carolyn Kormann is a staff writer at The New Yorker.Read more »More:AnimalsBiodiversityBooksDive into the world of literature with The New Yorker’s weekly fiction newsletter.SubmitMost Popular1.A Reporter at LargeGuantánamo’s Darkest SecretBy Ben Taub2.News DeskSecrecy, Self-Dealing, and Greed at the N.R.A.By Mike Spies3.Letter from Trump’s WashingtonThe Mueller Report Won’t End Trump’s Presidency, But It Sure Makes Him Look BadBy Susan B.

His mission: to record Earth’s remaining tracts of wilderness and their inhabitants. His enormous archive—much of it captured on seven-inch reels of quarter-inch-wide audiotape—contains the sounds made by more than fifteen thousand species, and more than five thousand hours of “holistic habitat,” or the entire synchronous soundscape, from insects and birds to bellowing orangutans. And yet, as Krause recounts in his slender new book, “Voices of the Wild: Animal Songs, Human Din, and the Call to Save Natural Soundscapes,” more than half of his audio data “comes from sites [now] so badly compromised by various forms of human intervention that the habitats are either altogether silent or the soundscapes can no longer be heard in any of their original forms.” His collection is an auditory Library of Alexandria for everything nonhuman.Listen here to one of Krause’s soundscape recordings, featuring an orangutan, among many other species:Krause, who once played guitar for the Weavers, Pete Seeger’s popular folk band, had a long career as a studio musician, pioneering the use of the Moog synthesizer in film and pop music. (If you know where to listen, you can hear his work in “Apocalypse Now” and “Love Story.”) His growing obsession with natural soundscapes carried him out of the commercial entertainment world—and led eventually to commissions from museums, zoos, aquariums, arts groups, orchestras, even a ballet company and a TED talk (yellow-colored glasses, purple shirt, hiking sneakers). His work has been hailed by E. O. Wilson and Jane Goodall. When he’s not in Borneo or Rwanda, he lives with his wife, Katherine, in the California wine country, where they run an organization called Wild Sanctuary.Krause’s 2012 book, “The Great Animal Orchestra,” includes descriptions of some of the animal music he has discovered: a honking sea anemone, a beaver’s eerie keening after a human killed his mate. His new book surveys the broad field of bioacoustics, “the study of the sounds living animals produce.” Until recently, most scientists who went into the field to record animals tried to isolate individual species’ sounds. Ornithologists are largely responsible for this model—they made some of the earliest field recordings, pushing to develop technology that could capture an individual bird’s call removed from its larger environmental context. Cornell University’s Macaulay Library describes itself as “the world’s largest and oldest scientific archive of biodiversity audio and video recordings,” yet there are only bird species on its “Audio Most Wanted” list (masked duck, red-faced cormorant). Krause, however, is interested in a given habitat’s entire soundscape—its “biophony”—and finds the single-species paradigm absurd. He writes that it’s “like trying to understand the magnificence of Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony by abstracting the sound of a single violin player out of the context of the orchestra and hearing only that one part.”He and others have developed a hypothesis: that each living organism in a biome evolves in situ to find its own acoustic niche, based either on frequency or time, so that “their utterances are not buried by other signals.” Thus, each animal sound, plus the sounds of the wind in the trees, or waves on a beach, fit together like pieces of a puzzle to create the kaleidoscopic composition we hear. According to this theory, animals change their sounds when their habitat changes. Krause cites a study that found killer whales, for instance, will alter their vocalizations to accommodate the presence of boat noise.Krause wants more scientists to monitor the health of ecosystems by regularly recording the collective sounds of a particular habitat, generating “solid baseline data to use in comparing site changes over time.” He himself repeatedly recorded a forest site in California’s Sierra Nevada for more than twenty-five years. In 1988, the site was subjected to “selective logging,” which, according to the timber company doing the logging, would have no environmental impact. Yet Krause’s tapes of the post-logging years sound like a weak middle-school jazz band playing where there had once been the New York Philharmonic. The forest looked relatively healthy and unchanged. Tracking natural soundscapes over time, Krause argues, can uncover levels of habitat degradation that aren’t visually apparent. Baseline biophonies can also be used “to articulate the effects of climate change.”“Voices of the Wild” reads like an extended introduction to work and research that has yet to be done. Krause calls for better methods of statistically measuring how human din (“anthropophony”) affects natural soundscapes. For the most part, his and his colleagues’ work hasn’t proven sufficient to push back against mining, timber, and fossil-fuel companies that want to develop wild lands, or groups that want to increase motorized access in national parks. In one case, though, Krause and others were able to demonstrate that snowmobile noise in Yellowstone National Park had a negative impact on wildlife and humans alike, which led the federal government to restrict access.Humans evolved while relying on the soundscapes of forests and plains to hunt, navigate, and find refuge.

Tracking natural soundscapes over time, Krause argues, can uncover levels of habitat degradation that aren’t visually apparent. Baseline biophonies can also be used “to articulate the effects of climate change.”“Voices of the Wild” reads like an extended introduction to work and research that has yet to be done. Krause calls for better methods of statistically measuring how human din (“anthropophony”) affects natural soundscapes. For the most part, his and his colleagues’ work hasn’t proven sufficient to push back against mining, timber, and fossil-fuel companies that want to develop wild lands, or groups that want to increase motorized access in national parks. In one case, though, Krause and others were able to demonstrate that snowmobile noise in Yellowstone National Park had a negative impact on wildlife and humans alike, which led the federal government to restrict access.Humans evolved while relying on the soundscapes of forests and plains to hunt, navigate, and find refuge. Krause wants more people to seek out natural sounds and learn (or remember) how to listen. Recent studies of the effects of human din (such as automobile and aircraft traffic) have found that it can cause depression, high stress levels, insomnia, and headaches. It has even been linked to lowered I.Q. scores among children. On the other hand, some studies suggest that “the emotional consequences of natural soundscapes on urban-living humans may have a huge positive effect on our sense of well-being.” Krause cites a common Japanese preventative health-care practice, scientifically shown to have robust mental and physical benefits, known as Shinrin-yoku_,_ or “forest bathing.”Krause reminds me of someone who is mentioned in the novel “Dept. of Speculation,” by Jenny Offill. The narrator of that book describes a “man who travels around the world trying to find places where you can stand still and hear no human sound.” She goes on, “It is impossible to feel calm in cities, he believes, because we so rarely hear birdsong there. Our ears evolved to be our warning systems. We are on high alert in places where no birds sing.”One morning, on a walk in the Colorado Rockies, I learned that I have lost that particular ancient warning system. It was just after sunrise, and I was walking with a friend’s dog, Mojo, along a canyon trail. A mule deer suddenly leapt across our path. I was startled, but delighted. I should have noticed that the birds had stopped singing. A few seconds passed. Then came the roar.I had never heard a sound like it. Mojo froze, then bolted down the hill. I sprinted after him. A year and a half later, my friends in Colorado e-mailed me a video. They had set up a camera trap to see if they could get footage of the big predator terrorizing the canyon. (One man had found his pet Chihuahuas’ heads. Just the heads.) I saw a grainy, shadowy image of the familiar, aspen-lined trail. Then, slinking across the frame, a pale mountain lion appeared, svelte and magnificent.I wish I had a recording of that roar; I wonder if I will ever hear another sound like it. I was happy when, not long ago, I heard that a fresh elk carcass had been found back in the canyon. The mountain lion was still there, padding across the red-clay outcrops, roaring at whatever might interrupt her breakfast.Since 1968, Bernie Krause, a seventy-six-year-old musician, writer, and self-described “soundscape ecologist,” has visited every continent, often carrying cumbersome and heavy equipment. His mission: to record Earth’s remaining tracts of wilderness and their inhabitants. His enormous archive—much of it captured on seven-inch reels of quarter-inch-wide audiotape—contains the sounds made by more than fifteen thousand species, and more than five thousand hours of “holistic habitat,” or the entire synchronous soundscape, from insects and birds to bellowing orangutans. And yet, as Krause recounts in his slender new book, “Voices of the Wild: Animal Songs, Human Din, and the Call to Save Natural Soundscapes,” more than half of his audio data “comes from sites [now] so badly compromised by various forms of human intervention that the habitats are either altogether silent or the soundscapes can no longer be heard in any of their original forms.” His collection is an auditory Library of Alexandria for everything nonhuman.Listen here to one of Krause’s soundscape recordings, featuring an orangutan, among many other species:Krause, who once played guitar for the Weavers, Pete Seeger’s popular folk band, had a long career as a studio musician, pioneering the use of the Moog synthesizer in film and pop music. (If you know where to listen, you can hear his work in “Apocalypse Now” and “Love Story.”) His growing obsession with natural soundscapes carried him out of the commercial entertainment world—and led eventually to commissions from museums, zoos, aquariums, arts groups, orchestras, even a ballet company and a TED talk (yellow-colored glasses, purple shirt, hiking sneakers). His work has been hailed by E. O. Wilson and Jane Goodall. When he’s not in Borneo or Rwanda, he lives with his wife, Katherine, in the California wine country, where they run an organization called Wild Sanctuary.Krause’s 2012 book, “The Great Animal Orchestra,” includes descriptions of some of the animal music he has discovered: a honking sea anemone, a beaver’s eerie keening after a human killed his mate. His new book surveys the broad field of bioacoustics, “the study of the sounds living animals produce.” Until recently, most scientists who went into the field to record animals tried to isolate individual species’ sounds. Ornithologists are largely responsible for this model—they made some of the earliest field recordings, pushing to develop technology that could capture an individual bird’s call removed from its larger environmental context. Cornell University’s Macaulay Library describes itself as “the world’s largest and oldest scientific archive of biodiversity audio and video recordings,” yet there are only bird species on its “Audio Most Wanted” list (masked duck, red-faced cormorant). Krause, however, is interested in a given habitat’s entire soundscape—its “biophony”—and finds the single-species paradigm absurd. He writes that it’s “like trying to understand the magnificence of Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony by abstracting the sound of a single violin player out of the context of the orchestra and hearing only that one part.”He and others have developed a hypothesis: that each living organism in a biome evolves in situ to find its own acoustic niche, based either on frequency or time, so that “their utterances are not buried by other signals.” Thus, each animal sound, plus the sounds of the wind in the trees, or waves on a beach, fit together like pieces of a puzzle to create the kaleidoscopic composition we hear. According to this theory, animals change their sounds when their habitat changes. Krause cites a study that found killer whales, for instance, will alter their vocalizations to accommodate the presence of boat noise.Krause wants more scientists to monitor the health of ecosystems by regularly recording the collective sounds of a particular habitat, generating “solid baseline data to use in comparing site changes over time.” He himself repeatedly recorded a forest site in California’s Sierra Nevada for more than twenty-five years. In 1988, the site was subjected to “selective logging,” which, according to the timber company doing the logging, would have no environmental impact. Yet Krause’s tapes of the post-logging years sound like a weak middle-school jazz band playing where there had once been the New York Philharmonic. The forest looked relatively healthy and unchanged.
