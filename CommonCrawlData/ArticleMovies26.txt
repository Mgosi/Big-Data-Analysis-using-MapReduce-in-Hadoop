Although the Phase 3 films will do quite a bit with regards to introducing new characters to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it will also allow us to check it with longtime favorites. Thor: Ragnarok in particular will give us our first look at Chris Hemsworth's Thor and Mark Ruffalo's Hulk since we last saw them in Avengers: Age of Ultron. It's been a while since we last saw these heroes, and a new glimpse at the Ragnarok set seems to indicate that a familiar vehicle will make a return as well. Check it out below.

A new behind-the-scenes photo has just hit Twitter, and it seems to indicate that there's a Stark Industries Quinjet currently under construction on the set of Thor: Ragnarok. We all know that Thor can already fly and the Asgardians have their own form of aerial transportation, which means that an outsider will obviously pilot this particular vehicle. Given the fact that Hulk will feature prominently in the narrative of Thor: Ragnarok, it seems very likely that this is the exact same Quinjet that he flew away in during the climax of Avengers: Age of Ultron. Since May 2015 fans have wondered where the giant green Avenger went, and now it seems that he somehow ended up in Asgard.

Knowing where Hulk went at the end of Age of Ultron will go a long way towards continuing his arc as a character. Considering the emotional fallout of his relationship with Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) it looks entirely plausible that Bruce Banner could look to his fellow Avenger for guidance and support during this tumultuous period. They might even get to do a little bonding in between massive battles.
This photo also just continues to highlight one major thing that Marvel does better than anybody: continuity. The MCU has done a remarkable job of building upon each and every Marvel movie in order to create something truly cohesive, and the addition of the Quinjet shows that Marvel will once again look to what previous movies have done in order to inform where the universe will go from here. It's a seemingly minor detail, but it's one that makes a serious difference to long-time fans.
With the addition of a Stark Industries Quinjet, our excitement for Hulk and Thor's upcoming team-up has reached sky-high levels. Cinema Blend will bring you any and all relevant details related to Thor: Ragnarok as more information becomes available; the Asgardian's third solo movie will hit theaters next year on November 3, 2017.

Although the Phase 3 films will do quite a bit with regards to introducing new characters to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it will also allow us to check it with longtime favorites. Thor: Ragnarok in particular will give us our first look at Chris Hemsworth's Thor and Mark Ruffalo's Hulk since we last saw them in Avengers: Age of Ultron. It's been a while since we last saw these heroes, and a new glimpse at the Ragnarok set seems to indicate that a familiar vehicle will make a return as well. Check it out below.

A new behind-the-scenes photo has just hit Twitter, and it seems to indicate that there's a Stark Industries Quinjet currently under construction on the set of Thor: Ragnarok. We all know that Thor can already fly and the Asgardians have their own form of aerial transportation, which means that an outsider will obviously pilot this particular vehicle. Given the fact that Hulk will feature prominently in the narrative of Thor: Ragnarok, it seems very likely that this is the exact same Quinjet that he flew away in during the climax of Avengers: Age of Ultron. Since May 2015 fans have wondered where the giant green Avenger went, and now it seems that he somehow ended up in Asgard.

Since May 2015 fans have wondered where the giant green Avenger went, and now it seems that he somehow ended up in Asgard.

 


Knowing where Hulk went at the end of Age of Ultron will go a long way towards continuing his arc as a character. Considering the emotional fallout of his relationship with Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) it looks entirely plausible that Bruce Banner could look to his fellow Avenger for guidance and support during this tumultuous period. They might even get to do a little bonding in between massive battles.
This photo also just continues to highlight one major thing that Marvel does better than anybody: continuity. The MCU has done a remarkable job of building upon each and every Marvel movie in order to create something truly cohesive, and the addition of the Quinjet shows that Marvel will once again look to what previous movies have done in order to inform where the universe will go from here. It's a seemingly minor detail, but it's one that makes a serious difference to long-time fans.
With the addition of a Stark Industries Quinjet, our excitement for Hulk and Thor's upcoming team-up has reached sky-high levels. Cinema Blend will bring you any and all relevant details related to Thor: Ragnarok as more information becomes available; the Asgardian's third solo movie will hit theaters next year on November 3, 2017.
