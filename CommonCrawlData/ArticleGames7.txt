            Vivendi
 SA

        VIVHY 0.23%


      is set to buy out the founding family of French mobile-gaming company






        Gameloft SE
,


      taking the French media and entertainment group a step closer to rebuilding its videogame franchise.The Guillemot family said it has decided to sell the bulk of its shares “with regret” to Vivendi which last week controlled around 56% of Gameloft’s voting rights, according to the French stock market regulator. Vivendi made an unsolicited takeover approach for the games editor earlier this year. “The family maintains that Vivendi’s hostile approach goes against the best interest of Gameloft, both for its activity and for its teams,” the Guillemot family said in a statement.The Guillemot family held 21.7% of Gameloft’s capital on April 4.Vivendi said last week that Gameloft would benefit from its industrial and financial backing to grow. It reopened its bid for Gameloft until June 15 on the same terms to the €8 ($9) per share offer it made last month, valuing the company at around €700 million, and said that it would appoint a majority of Gameloft’s board of directors on June 29 to reflect the results of its tender offer.Since October last year, Vivendi, controlled by French billionaire Vincent Bolloré,  has been buying shares in Gameloft, a company with success in creating games for mobile phones. Gameloft was founded by Michel Guillemot and his four brothers in 1999 and counts “Despicable Me: Minion Rush” and “Dragon Mania Legends” among its best-known games. It logged sales of €256.2 million in 2015.The Guillemot family failed in a court bid to block Vivendi’s tender offer for Gameloft, leaving them with few options to fight off Vivendi.A resolution in the battle for Gameloft sets the stage for a bigger tussle over

      SE, also run by the Guillemots, according to analysts. Vivendi owns 17.7% of Ubisoft and is seeking board representation, but said in a stock market filing on April 29 that it has no plans to seek control of Ubisoft or submit a public offer for its shares for the next six months.Ubisoft, which is known for franchises such as “Assassin’s Creed,” has a market capitalization of €3.7 billion, several times that of Gameloft’s. It has so far been hostile to Vivendi’s advances.In 2013, Vivendi sold most of its controlling stake in videogames giant

PARIS—






            Vivendi
 SA

        VIVHY 0.23%


      is set to buy out the founding family of French mobile-gaming company






        Gameloft SE
,


      taking the French media and entertainment group a step closer to rebuilding its videogame franchise.
The Guillemot family said it has decided to sell the bulk of its shares “with regret” to Vivendi which last week controlled around 56% of Gameloft’s voting rights, according to the French stock market regulator. Vivendi made an unsolicited takeover approach for the games editor earlier this year.
 “The family maintains that Vivendi’s hostile approach goes against the best interest of Gameloft, both for its activity and for its teams,” the Guillemot family said in a statement.
 The Guillemot family held 21.7% of Gameloft’s capital on April 4.
Vivendi said last week that Gameloft would benefit from its industrial and financial backing to grow. It reopened its bid for Gameloft until June 15 on the same terms to the €8 ($9) per share offer it made last month, valuing the company at around €700 million, and said that it would appoint a majority of Gameloft’s board of directors on June 29 to reflect the results of its tender offer.

Since October last year, Vivendi, controlled by French billionaire Vincent Bolloré,  has been buying shares in Gameloft, a company with success in creating games for mobile phones. Gameloft was founded by Michel Guillemot and his four brothers in 1999 and counts “Despicable Me: Minion Rush” and “Dragon Mania Legends” among its best-known games. It logged sales of €256.2 million in 2015.
The Guillemot family failed in a court bid to block Vivendi’s tender offer for Gameloft, leaving them with few options to fight off Vivendi.
A resolution in the battle for Gameloft sets the stage for a bigger tussle over






            Ubisoft Entertainment
            


      SE, also run by the Guillemots, according to analysts. Vivendi owns 17.7% of Ubisoft and is seeking board representation, but said in a stock market filing on April 29 that it has no plans to seek control of Ubisoft or submit a public offer for its shares for the next six months.
Ubisoft, which is known for franchises such as “Assassin’s Creed,” has a market capitalization of €3.7 billion, several times that of Gameloft’s. It has so far been hostile to Vivendi’s advances.
In 2013, Vivendi sold most of its controlling stake in videogames giant






            Activision Blizzard
 Inc.


      as part of a number of asset sales to boost a sagging share price, leaving it to focus on the TV and music side of its business at the time.

PARIS—






            Vivendi
 SA

        VIVHY 0.23%


      is set to buy out the founding family of French mobile-gaming company






        Gameloft SE
,


      taking the French media and entertainment group a step closer to rebuilding its videogame franchise.
The Guillemot family said it has decided to sell the bulk of its shares “with regret” to Vivendi which last week controlled around 56% of Gameloft’s voting rights, according to the French stock market regulator. Vivendi made an unsolicited takeover approach for the games editor earlier this year.
 “The family maintains that Vivendi’s hostile approach goes against the best interest of Gameloft, both for its activity and for its teams,” the Guillemot family said in a statement.
 The Guillemot family held 21.7% of Gameloft’s capital on April 4.
Vivendi said last week that Gameloft would benefit from its industrial and financial backing to grow. It reopened its bid for Gameloft until June 15 on the same terms to the €8 ($9) per share offer it made last month, valuing the company at around €700 million, and said that it would appoint a majority of Gameloft’s board of directors on June 29 to reflect the results of its tender offer.

Since October last year, Vivendi, controlled by French billionaire Vincent Bolloré,  has been buying shares in Gameloft, a company with success in creating games for mobile phones. Gameloft was founded by Michel Guillemot and his four brothers in 1999 and counts “Despicable Me: Minion Rush” and “Dragon Mania Legends” among its best-known games. It logged sales of €256.2 million in 2015.
The Guillemot family failed in a court bid to block Vivendi’s tender offer for Gameloft, leaving them with few options to fight off Vivendi.
A resolution in the battle for Gameloft sets the stage for a bigger tussle over






            Ubisoft Entertainment
            


      SE, also run by the Guillemots, according to analysts. Vivendi owns 17.7% of Ubisoft and is seeking board representation, but said in a stock market filing on April 29 that it has no plans to seek control of Ubisoft or submit a public offer for its shares for the next six months.
Ubisoft, which is known for franchises such as “Assassin’s Creed,” has a market capitalization of €3.7 billion, several times that of Gameloft’s. It has so far been hostile to Vivendi’s advances.
In 2013, Vivendi sold most of its controlling stake in videogames giant






            Activision Blizzard
 Inc.


      as part of a number of asset sales to boost a sagging share price, leaving it to focus on the TV and music side of its business at the time.

PARIS—






            Vivendi
 SA

        VIVHY 0.23%


      is set to buy out the founding family of French mobile-gaming company






        Gameloft SE
,


      taking the French media and entertainment group a step closer to rebuilding its videogame franchise.
The Guillemot family said it has decided to sell the bulk of its shares “with regret” to Vivendi which last week controlled around 56% of Gameloft’s voting rights, according to the French stock market regulator. Vivendi made an unsolicited takeover approach for the games editor earlier this year.
 “The family maintains that Vivendi’s hostile approach goes against the best interest of Gameloft, both for its activity and for its teams,” the Guillemot family said in a statement.
 The Guillemot family held 21.7% of Gameloft’s capital on April 4.
Vivendi said last week that Gameloft would benefit from its industrial and financial backing to grow. It reopened its bid for Gameloft until June 15 on the same terms to the €8 ($9) per share offer it made last month, valuing the company at around €700 million, and said that it would appoint a majority of Gameloft’s board of directors on June 29 to reflect the results of its tender offer.

Since October last year, Vivendi, controlled by French billionaire Vincent Bolloré,  has been buying shares in Gameloft, a company with success in creating games for mobile phones. Gameloft was founded by Michel Guillemot and his four brothers in 1999 and counts “Despicable Me: Minion Rush” and “Dragon Mania Legends” among its best-known games. It logged sales of €256.2 million in 2015.
The Guillemot family failed in a court bid to block Vivendi’s tender offer for Gameloft, leaving them with few options to fight off Vivendi.
A resolution in the battle for Gameloft sets the stage for a bigger tussle over






            Ubisoft Entertainment
            


      SE, also run by the Guillemots, according to analysts. Vivendi owns 17.7% of Ubisoft and is seeking board representation, but said in a stock market filing on April 29 that it has no plans to seek control of Ubisoft or submit a public offer for its shares for the next six months.
Ubisoft, which is known for franchises such as “Assassin’s Creed,” has a market capitalization of €3.7 billion, several times that of Gameloft’s. It has so far been hostile to Vivendi’s advances.
In 2013, Vivendi sold most of its controlling stake in videogames giant






            Activision Blizzard
 Inc.


      as part of a number of asset sales to boost a sagging share price, leaving it to focus on the TV and music side of its business at the time.

      taking the French media and entertainment group a step closer to rebuilding its videogame franchise.
The Guillemot family said it has decided to sell the bulk of its shares “with regret” to Vivendi which last week controlled around 56% of Gameloft’s voting rights, according to the French stock market regulator. Vivendi made an unsolicited takeover approach for the games editor earlier this year.
 “The family maintains that Vivendi’s hostile approach goes against the best interest of Gameloft, both for its activity and for its teams,” the Guillemot family said in a statement.
 The Guillemot family held 21.7% of Gameloft’s capital on April 4.
Vivendi said last week that Gameloft would benefit from its industrial and financial backing to grow. It reopened its bid for Gameloft until June 15 on the same terms to the €8 ($9) per share offer it made last month, valuing the company at around €700 million, and said that it would appoint a majority of Gameloft’s board of directors on June 29 to reflect the results of its tender offer.

Since October last year, Vivendi, controlled by French billionaire Vincent Bolloré,  has been buying shares in Gameloft, a company with success in creating games for mobile phones. Gameloft was founded by Michel Guillemot and his four brothers in 1999 and counts “Despicable Me: Minion Rush” and “Dragon Mania Legends” among its best-known games. It logged sales of €256.2 million in 2015.
The Guillemot family failed in a court bid to block Vivendi’s tender offer for Gameloft, leaving them with few options to fight off Vivendi.

Ubisoft, which is known for franchises such as “Assassin’s Creed,” has a market capitalization of €3.7 billion, several times that of Gameloft’s. It has so far been hostile to Vivendi’s advances.

The Guillemot family said it has decided to sell the bulk of its shares “with regret” to Vivendi which last week controlled around 56% of Gameloft’s voting rights, according to the French stock market regulator. Vivendi made an unsolicited takeover approach for the games editor earlier this year.
 “The family maintains that Vivendi’s hostile approach goes against the best interest of Gameloft, both for its activity and for its teams,” the Guillemot family said in a statement.
 The Guillemot family held 21.7% of Gameloft’s capital on April 4.
Vivendi said last week that Gameloft would benefit from its industrial and financial backing to grow. It reopened its bid for Gameloft until June 15 on the same terms to the €8 ($9) per share offer it made last month, valuing the company at around €700 million, and said that it would appoint a majority of Gameloft’s board of directors on June 29 to reflect the results of its tender offer.

Since October last year, Vivendi, controlled by French billionaire Vincent Bolloré,  has been buying shares in Gameloft, a company with success in creating games for mobile phones. Gameloft was founded by Michel Guillemot and his four brothers in 1999 and counts “Despicable Me: Minion Rush” and “Dragon Mania Legends” among its best-known games. It logged sales of €256.2 million in 2015.
The Guillemot family failed in a court bid to block Vivendi’s tender offer for Gameloft, leaving them with few options to fight off Vivendi.

Ubisoft, which is known for franchises such as “Assassin’s Creed,” has a market capitalization of €3.7 billion, several times that of Gameloft’s. It has so far been hostile to Vivendi’s advances.
