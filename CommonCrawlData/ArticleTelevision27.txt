Subscribe To CBS Is Getting A Candy Crush TV Series UpdatesThe world of entertainment has no problem with making TV shows and movies out of all sorts of products. Video games have become TV and film premises, as have board games and more. Now, it looks as if a mobile app is getting the TV treatment. If you are familiar with King's wildly popular Candy Crush game, you'll soon be able to see a version of it on CBS.The new series, aptly titled Candy Crush, is being described as an hour-long game show series. Unlike the original game, it will not be animated and will feature live action components. If you are wondering what this will look like, CBS' announcement comes with a description, as well. Basically, the show will bring on two contestants who must use "wits" and "physical agility" to compete on a giant board that presumably looks a lot like a level of the original Candy Crush game. A host will also need to be a part of this game show, but CBS hasn't gotten far enough that the network has hired anyone yet. We'll let you know when that changes.I'm someone who has spent more hours than I am currently comfortable divulging playing Candy Crush. I've done so well, I don't even want to tell you what level I am on. I'm not the only one playing. King has mentioned Candy Crush does 18 billion rounds every month. One would think all of these players are the target audience for this sort of televised event, but as someone who has played, I find the whole concept is just totally strange. The good news? Game shows have a long-standing history of being really strange.Are you Smarter Than A Fifth Grader? is a pretty self-explanatory series with an oddball concept. Getting weirder, Fox had a game show called Solitary where contestants were locked into rooms alone and forced to keep odd hours and accomplish crazy tasks in order to stay in the game. Hellavator forces contestants into a "haunted" elevator where they compete in challenges. If you look at content overseas, things can get even weirder, with game shows dedicated to men trying to complete karaoke while they get a handjob and women fighting to try not to swallow large bugs.While CBS has a few long-running competition shows in the schedule, most CBS-owned game shows are daytime programming like The Price is Right and Let's Make A Deal. The network isn't stating whether or not Candy Crush will be a daytime product. Honestly, it would be interesting if the network tried it out as a nighttime program in the summer, replacing originals like BrainDead and American Gothic, which were cancelled only recently.For now, it looks as if Candy Crush is definitely heading to series. Usually it doesn't take too long for game shows to get off the ground and we'll let you know as soon as the Eye Network figures out a premiere date and timeslot. In the meantime, the networks are currently still rolling out all of their fall content. If you'd like to see what has yet to premiere on network, cable and streaming outlets, check out our fall TV premiere schedule.

The world of entertainment has no problem with making TV shows and movies out of all sorts of products. Video games have become TV and film premises, as have board games and more. Now, it looks as if a mobile app is getting the TV treatment. If you are familiar with King's wildly popular Candy Crush game, you'll soon be able to see a version of it on CBS.


(window._jsqueue=window._jsqueue||[]).push("3592eae2-ae60-4c13-b179-97cbcefbc6eb");

The new series, aptly titled Candy Crush, is being described as an hour-long game show series. Unlike the original game, it will not be animated and will feature live action components. If you are wondering what this will look like, CBS' announcement comes with a description, as well. Basically, the show will bring on two contestants who must use "wits" and "physical agility" to compete on a giant board that presumably looks a lot like a level of the original Candy Crush game. A host will also need to be a part of this game show, but CBS hasn't gotten far enough that the network has hired anyone yet. We'll let you know when that changes.


(window._jsqueue=window._jsqueue||[]).push("403ae378-ae36-4d9f-84e1-41cf39e50ec7");

I'm someone who has spent more hours than I am currently comfortable divulging playing Candy Crush. I've done so well, I don't even want to tell you what level I am on. I'm not the only one playing. King has mentioned Candy Crush does 18 billion rounds every month. One would think all of these players are the target audience for this sort of televised event, but as someone who has played, I find the whole concept is just totally strange. The good news? Game shows have a long-standing history of being really strange.


(window._jsqueue=window._jsqueue||[]).push("78b5a0bc-0413-4c03-9e25-575414d6e6b9");

Are you Smarter Than A Fifth Grader? is a pretty self-explanatory series with an oddball concept. Getting weirder, Fox had a game show called Solitary where contestants were locked into rooms alone and forced to keep odd hours and accomplish crazy tasks in order to stay in the game. Hellavator forces contestants into a "haunted" elevator where they compete in challenges. If you look at content overseas, things can get even weirder, with game shows dedicated to men trying to complete karaoke while they get a handjob and women fighting to try not to swallow large bugs.


(window._jsqueue=window._jsqueue||[]).push("55760148-44ab-43f7-b3f8-60f1a8ea3459");

While CBS has a few long-running competition shows in the schedule, most CBS-owned game shows are daytime programming like The Price is Right and Let's Make A Deal. The network isn't stating whether or not Candy Crush will be a daytime product. Honestly, it would be interesting if the network tried it out as a nighttime program in the summer, replacing originals like BrainDead and American Gothic, which were cancelled only recently.


(window._jsqueue=window._jsqueue||[]).push("40cefff1-0c02-4c34-94c2-33b278f74c18");

For now, it looks as if Candy Crush is definitely heading to series. Usually it doesn't take too long for game shows to get off the ground and we'll let you know as soon as the Eye Network figures out a premiere date and timeslot. In the meantime, the networks are currently still rolling out all of their fall content. If you'd like to see what has yet to premiere on network, cable and streaming outlets, check out our fall TV premiere schedule.

The world of entertainment has no problem with making TV shows and movies out of all sorts of products. Video games have become TV and film premises, as have board games and more. Now, it looks as if a mobile app is getting the TV treatment. If you are familiar with King's wildly popular Candy Crush game, you'll soon be able to see a version of it on CBS.

The new series, aptly titled Candy Crush, is being described as an hour-long game show series. Unlike the original game, it will not be animated and will feature live action components. If you are wondering what this will look like, CBS' announcement comes with a description, as well. Basically, the show will bring on two contestants who must use "wits" and "physical agility" to compete on a giant board that presumably looks a lot like a level of the original Candy Crush game. A host will also need to be a part of this game show, but CBS hasn't gotten far enough that the network has hired anyone yet. We'll let you know when that changes.

I'm someone who has spent more hours than I am currently comfortable divulging playing Candy Crush. I've done so well, I don't even want to tell you what level I am on. I'm not the only one playing. King has mentioned Candy Crush does 18 billion rounds every month. One would think all of these players are the target audience for this sort of televised event, but as someone who has played, I find the whole concept is just totally strange. The good news? Game shows have a long-standing history of being really strange.

Are you Smarter Than A Fifth Grader? is a pretty self-explanatory series with an oddball concept. Getting weirder, Fox had a game show called Solitary where contestants were locked into rooms alone and forced to keep odd hours and accomplish crazy tasks in order to stay in the game. Hellavator forces contestants into a "haunted" elevator where they compete in challenges. If you look at content overseas, things can get even weirder, with game shows dedicated to men trying to complete karaoke while they get a handjob and women fighting to try not to swallow large bugs.

I'm someone who has spent more hours than I am currently comfortable divulging playing Candy Crush. I've done so well, I don't even want to tell you what level I am on. I'm not the only one playing. King has mentioned Candy Crush does 18 billion rounds every month. One would think all of these players are the target audience for this sort of televised event, but as someone who has played, I find the whole concept is just totally strange. The good news? Game shows have a long-standing history of being really strange.

While CBS has a few long-running competition shows in the schedule, most CBS-owned game shows are daytime programming like The Price is Right and Let's Make A Deal. The network isn't stating whether or not Candy Crush will be a daytime product. Honestly, it would be interesting if the network tried it out as a nighttime program in the summer, replacing originals like BrainDead and American Gothic, which were cancelled only recently.

For now, it looks as if Candy Crush is definitely heading to series. Usually it doesn't take too long for game shows to get off the ground and we'll let you know as soon as the Eye Network figures out a premiere date and timeslot. In the meantime, the networks are currently still rolling out all of their fall content.
