It’s been almost exactly a year since former BBC host Jeremy Clarkson found himself in the middle of a hullaballoo in which a physical altercation with a Top Gear producer led to him getting fired from the show and booted from the network. Not one to take strife lying down, Clarkson is getting back in the driver’s seat with his former co-hosts James May and Richard Hammond for the trio’s new Amazon show. And now we have an idea of when we’ll finally be able to see it, thanks to May:
The autumn, or fall if you’re in the U.S. That’s as specific as I can be.

A season so nice, it had to be said twice, and in two different ways. That’s right, ladies and gents, we will finally get to put our peepers on this team’s latest mindblowing automotive showcases later this year. Possibly in as few as six months, and possibly not until early December, depending on what’s delaying the show’s release. It’s hard to tell if it’s just business as usual or something out of the ordinary, considering we really don’t know much at all about the highly anticipated new series.



Back when it was first announced, it was revealed that Amazon dropped a ton of moolah on securing Clarkson, May and Hammond for the new project. And very few details have come out since. I mean, we know that changes were being made, as several of the elements that made Top Gear great (such as “the Star in a Reasonably Priced Car”) were all scrapped because those concepts were owned by the BBC. So we know there are going to be tons of new segments and approaches to bringing out the joy of automobiles, but that’s about it.

It’s unfortunate that James May didn’t use his Reddit AMA time to go into extreme details about what fans will see. I mean, knowing when the show is premiering is great, too, but it’s impossible to know what to expect at this point. Hopefully, though, Jeremy Clarkson will reassess his behavior at the BBC in the past – he wasn’t exactly an angel before he got fired – and we can look forward to watching him on Amazon for a long time without any lawsuits coming in to muck things up.

In the meantime, we’re waiting to see what’s going to happen with the revamped Top Gear, with new host Chris Evans and presenters Matt LeBlanc, Rory Reid, Sabine Schmitz, Chris Harris and Eddie Jordan. The first of six episodes will debut on the BBC on May 22, with Netflix reportedly looking into syndicating the show in the future.

After what feels like the longest wait ever, are you guys pumped to see Jeremy Clarkson behind the wheel again?

It’s unfortunate that James May didn’t use his Reddit AMA time to go into extreme details about what fans will see.

Hopefully, though, Jeremy Clarkson will reassess his behavior at the BBC in the past – he wasn’t exactly an angel before he got fired – and we can look forward to watching him on Amazon for a long time without any lawsuits coming in to muck things up.

In the meantime, we’re waiting to see what’s going to happen with the revamped Top Gear, with new host Chris Evans and presenters Matt LeBlanc, Rory Reid, Sabine Schmitz, Chris Harris and Eddie Jordan. The first of six episodes will debut on the BBC on May 22, with Netflix reportedly looking into syndicating the show in the future.

After what feels like the longest wait ever, are you guys pumped to see Jeremy Clarkson behind the wheel again?

When Jeremy Clarkson's New Show Will Be Available On Amazon




When Jeremy Clarkson's New Show Will Be Available On Amazon

It’s been almost exactly a year since former BBC host Jeremy Clarkson found himself in the middle of a hullaballoo in which a physical altercation with a Top Gear producer led to him getting fired from the show and booted from the network. Not one to take strife lying down, Clarkson is getting back in the driver’s seat with his former co-hosts James May and Richard Hammond for the trio’s new Amazon show. And now we have an idea of when we’ll finally be able to see it, thanks to May:
The autumn, or fall if you’re in the U.S. That’s as specific as I can be.

A season so nice, it had to be said twice, and in two different ways. That’s right, ladies and gents, we will finally get to put our peepers on this team’s latest mindblowing automotive showcases later this year. Possibly in as few as six months, and possibly not until early December, depending on what’s delaying the show’s release. It’s hard to tell if it’s just business as usual or something out of the ordinary, considering we really don’t know much at all about the highly anticipated new series.



Back when it was first announced, it was revealed that Amazon dropped a ton of moolah on securing Clarkson, May and Hammond for the new project. And very few details have come out since. I mean, we know that changes were being made, as several of the elements that made Top Gear great (such as “the Star in a Reasonably Priced Car”) were all scrapped because those concepts were owned by the BBC. So we know there are going to be tons of new segments and approaches to bringing out the joy of automobiles, but that’s about it.

It’s unfortunate that James May didn’t use his Reddit AMA time to go into extreme details about what fans will see. I mean, knowing when the show is premiering is great, too, but it’s impossible to know what to expect at this point. Hopefully, though, Jeremy Clarkson will reassess his behavior at the BBC in the past – he wasn’t exactly an angel before he got fired – and we can look forward to watching him on Amazon for a long time without any lawsuits coming in to muck things up.

In the meantime, we’re waiting to see what’s going to happen with the revamped Top Gear, with new host Chris Evans and presenters Matt LeBlanc, Rory Reid, Sabine Schmitz, Chris Harris and Eddie Jordan. The first of six episodes will debut on the BBC on May 22, with Netflix reportedly looking into syndicating the show in the future.

After what feels like the longest wait ever, are you guys pumped to see Jeremy Clarkson behind the wheel again?
