Aside from that Oscar-winning James Bond song, it's been a long time since we've heard from Adele. 2015 has been filled with consistent murmurs that her long-awaited follow-up to the blockbuster 2011 album 21 is on the way, and this morning (Oct. 21), Adele herself finally addressed the impending album in a contemplative letter to fans.First things first: She doesn't confirm a release date, but she does seem to confirm the title of the album will be 25, as hinted previously. And while no hard drop date is given, it seems a 2015 release is likely given the words her post ends on: "I'm sorry it took so long, but you know, life happened."Adele's '21' Surpasses 11 Million U.S. Sales"Sorry it took so long" isn't the kind of thing you say if you're making fans wait another three months (or industry execs wait another quarter) for a record. Plus, given that an Adele album is a perfect cross-generational holiday gift item, expect 25 before 2015 is over.She also shares how 25 will differ from 21, the Grammy-winning album that has sold more than 11 million copies in the U.S.: "My last record was a break-up record and if I had to label this one I would call it a make-up record. I'm making up with myself. I'm making up for lost time."You can read Adele's full letter below. It's a reflective read where Adele, like many artists before, realizes that the phase of struggling to succeed/working to grow up is actually a lot more fun than success itself/being a grown-up. "Even following and breaking rules… is better than making the rules," Adele writes, providing us with a truth bomb we'd be shocked to hear literally any other pop star in 2015 say.  pic.twitter.com/dDImEhKt10The online extension of Billboard Magazine, billboard.biz is the essential online destination for the music business.Learn More© 2019 Billboard.
