A week after Robin Thicke’s “Blurred Lines” (Interscope/Universal), featuring TI and Pharrell Williams, became the U.K.’s fastest-selling single of 2013, that record has been broken again — by Thicke himself. The track followed its opening sales of 190,000 by selling close to 199,000 in its second week, reports the Official Charts Company. Meanwhile, British electronica duo Disclosure’s debut set “Settle” (PMR) overhauled the early-week lead of Queens of the Stone Age’s “Like Clockwork” (Matador) to hit the album summit. “Settle” was challenging QOTSA’s initial supremacy by midweek, with only 50 sales separating the titles by Thursday, and eventually triumphed by a margin of some 7,000. The OCC is hailing Thicke’s success as the latest sign of a banner period for the singles format. Average weekly sales of the No. 1 single over the past eight weeks have been 150,000, compared to the average throughout 2012 of 106,000. The company also says that the eight consecutive period of six-figure sales marks the first time that has happened without the aid of charity releases since October 1999.The top four on the singles chart were unchanged, with the former No. 1s “La La La” (Virgin/Universal) by Naughty Boy featuring Sam Smith and Daft Punk’s “Get Lucky” (Columbia/Sony Music Entertainment), featuring Pharrell Williams, steady in second and third spot, and Passenger’s “Let Her Go” (Nettwerk) at No. 4 again. OllyMurs improved 6-5 with “Dear Darlin’” (Epic/Sony). There were two new entries in the top ten: former “X Factor” boy band Union J, who finished fourth in last year’s series, with “Carry You” (RCA/Sony) at No. 6; and British-Ghanaian artist Fuse ODG’s “Antenna” (3 Beat/All Around The World/Universal), which features Wyclef Jean, at No. 7. Disclosure’s narrow victory over Queens of the Stone Age denied QOTSA their first U.K. No. 1 album. The band’s previous best was the No. 4 peak of both “Songs For The Deaf” in 2002 and 2005’s “Lullabies To Paralyze.” On the new survey, Daft Punk’s “Random Access Memories” fell to No. 3 after two weeks at the summit, and Rod Stewart’s “Time” (Capitol/Decca/Universal) 2-4.Miles Kane’s “Don’t Forget Who You Are” (Columbia/Sony) debuted at No. 8, beating the No. 11 peak of 2011’s “Colour of the Trap.” Murs jumped back 13-9 with “Right Place Right Time” and Caro Emerald’s former No. 1 “The Shocking Miss Emerald” (Grandmono/Dramatico) 11-10. “Now That’s What I Call 30 Years” (Sony Music/Virgin EMI) started a second week atop the compilation chart.The online extension of Billboard Magazine, billboard.biz is the essential online destination for the music business.Learn More© 2019 Billboard.
