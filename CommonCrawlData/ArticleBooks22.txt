By Talia LavinJanuary 23, 2017In my new, secular life, I have acted like a Roman and stolen my chicken soup from the Greeks.All chicken soups are alike at the start: a dead bird in water, boiling flesh, a billow of steam, grains of salt in the cook’s palm. Growing up, I ate Ashkenazi Jewish chicken soup, with sliced celery and parsnips, flavored with dill in a pouch of cheesecloth. Its weekly appearance at our table heralded the Sabbath, strictly observed in my Orthodox family, which meant a twenty-five-hour pause in labor. During that time, the work in my family was more abstract: loving, playing, making war on one another. By Saturday afternoon, an atlas of purple wine stains decorated the tablecloth.I left Orthodox Judaism when I left home, and I’ve never made a Jewish chicken soup since. When I return to my family’s table, it’s as a prodigal, wisecracking, chain-smoking daughter. In my new, secular life, I have acted like a Roman and stolen my chicken soup from the Greeks. It is called avgolemono: a broth of chicken thickened with whisked egg and lemon and fortified with rice and spinach. The name, Greek for “egg-lemon,” can in Mediterranean cuisine refer to a sauce, a broth, or a thickening agent; some sources say it harks back to the time of Alexander the Great. Other stories say it came to Greece along with Sephardic Jews expelled from Spain in the fifteenth century, who, even in Salonika, called it by its Ladino name, sopa de huevo y limón.I first found a recipe for avgolemono soup when searching for a birthday gift for my mother: I was going to cook up a big meal and serve it by candlelight, stealing a little of the language of romance. I found instructions on the Internet, and I came up with brandy apples, too, deglazed in a scary spout of flame. But foremost was the soup, which I had never tasted before. It was pale at the darkened table, silky, warm. In those days, I wanted to offer something so perfect that it would placate all parental disappointment, something that could garner only praise.In the Bible, the primary text of my religious childhood, the one figure who is given soup as a gift has far more taken from him in return. In Genesis, Esau is hungry; he has hunted all day, and he comes to his brother Jacob’s tent for food. Jacob gives him lentil stew (sometimes translated as pottage, mess, broth), and in exchange the clumsy, ruddy Esau gives up his firstborn rights. “He did eat and drink and got up and went on his way,” the Bible says. “So Esau despised his birthright.” Sometimes a gift is treachery. Sometimes you have to give up your birthright, and turn away from the tastes you knew.At twenty-seven, I have not yet learned to cook for just myself. For seven years, when I cooked at all, I cooked for the man who became my husband when I was twenty-four. At our wedding, the food was good—I don’t remember what we ate, but I remember that we continued eating throughout the toasts. At home in the years that followed, he was impatient with my need to roast a whole chicken; he could do up the thighs so well with oxtail spice or paprika. Salmon was his favorite, with butter and dill; I made it for birthdays and anniversaries. We were the kind of people who arrived at a party with a bowl of chopped liver and a pitcher of hurricane cocktails in sticky pink. We were married for two years: enough time to acquire a KitchenAid mixer but not enough to acquire children, enough time to share a studio apartment but not enough to buy a house. When I moved out, I took the pitcher shaped like an elephant and most of the platters, but I left in such a hurry that half my books remained.Since my divorce, I have begun to issue too many dinner invitations, although my kitchen, shared with three housemates, is cramped, and for months, until a friend intervened with screws, my grandmother’s walnut table wobbled perilously at the slightest touch. Nonetheless, I select recipes and, falsely casual, induce my friends to join me: come over; we’ll make lemon-drop cookies, I say. Sift confectioner’s sugar into a bowl, whisk in lemon juice, add still more sugar to thicken: the blandishments of my loneliness are sweet and acidic, brushed on, carefully, with a fork. Stay for dinner. I’ll make chicken. In solitude, my plate—blue Le Creuset ceramic, a wedding gift—is as empty as my bed.Some months after the divorce, I invited more friends than could fit into my tiny living room for a dinner. I laid out a card table that jutted into the kitchen, arranging folding chairs whose backs knocked the walls and caught at the door’s handle. I made scalloped potatoes. I blanched asparagus. I whacked at slivered almonds with a hardcover book, in an attempt to make a cake that was later described by my guests, not unkindly, as a granola or a brittle. The friends I invited had seen me sob in broad daylight when my husband first left. They had fielded calls at unreasonable hours. In return, I made them avgolemono.When the chicken has simmered for an hour, add a cup of long-grain rice; orzo is more traditionally Greek, but any rice will do. Then comes the trickiest step, tempering the eggs: it’s a magician’s flick of the wrist, the small skill that makes the soup a gift and a secret. Juice two lemons and beat three eggs in a bowl; take a ladleful of hot broth and whisk it into the yellow mixture. Repeat this action, beating in ladle after ladle until your fingertip tells you that the liquid is hot. Then turn off the heat on your pot of broth and pour in the lemon-and-egg; chase it to the far reaches with the whisk, until the broth clouds as suddenly as a summer storm. Don’t let the mixture boil, or the whites will turn to albuminous ribbons, the yolks to rubble, and the lovely color, like a newly painted parlor, will be wrecked. Be careful and be gentle. Shred the chicken’s flesh, salt it, let it slide back into the broth. At the last possible moment, drop a handful of spinach to wilt in the steam.Let the pot feed as many mouths as possible; dip the ladle until it scrapes the bottom clean. When the final guest has left, and you’re doing the dishes, take up the last spoonful, a small gift to yourself.

Growing up, I ate Ashkenazi Jewish chicken soup, with sliced celery and parsnips, flavored with dill in a pouch of cheesecloth. Its weekly appearance at our table heralded the Sabbath, strictly observed in my Orthodox family, which meant a twenty-five-hour pause in labor. During that time, the work in my family was more abstract: loving, playing, making war on one another. By Saturday afternoon, an atlas of purple wine stains decorated the tablecloth.I left Orthodox Judaism when I left home, and I’ve never made a Jewish chicken soup since. When I return to my family’s table, it’s as a prodigal, wisecracking, chain-smoking daughter. In my new, secular life, I have acted like a Roman and stolen my chicken soup from the Greeks. It is called avgolemono: a broth of chicken thickened with whisked egg and lemon and fortified with rice and spinach. The name, Greek for “egg-lemon,” can in Mediterranean cuisine refer to a sauce, a broth, or a thickening agent; some sources say it harks back to the time of Alexander the Great. Other stories say it came to Greece along with Sephardic Jews expelled from Spain in the fifteenth century, who, even in Salonika, called it by its Ladino name, sopa de huevo y limón.I first found a recipe for avgolemono soup when searching for a birthday gift for my mother: I was going to cook up a big meal and serve it by candlelight, stealing a little of the language of romance. I found instructions on the Internet, and I came up with brandy apples, too, deglazed in a scary spout of flame. But foremost was the soup, which I had never tasted before. It was pale at the darkened table, silky, warm. In those days, I wanted to offer something so perfect that it would placate all parental disappointment, something that could garner only praise.In the Bible, the primary text of my religious childhood, the one figure who is given soup as a gift has far more taken from him in return. In Genesis, Esau is hungry; he has hunted all day, and he comes to his brother Jacob’s tent for food. Jacob gives him lentil stew (sometimes translated as pottage, mess, broth), and in exchange the clumsy, ruddy Esau gives up his firstborn rights. “He did eat and drink and got up and went on his way,” the Bible says. “So Esau despised his birthright.” Sometimes a gift is treachery. Sometimes you have to give up your birthright, and turn away from the tastes you knew.At twenty-seven, I have not yet learned to cook for just myself. For seven years, when I cooked at all, I cooked for the man who became my husband when I was twenty-four. At our wedding, the food was good—I don’t remember what we ate, but I remember that we continued eating throughout the toasts. At home in the years that followed, he was impatient with my need to roast a whole chicken; he could do up the thighs so well with oxtail spice or paprika. Salmon was his favorite, with butter and dill; I made it for birthdays and anniversaries. We were the kind of people who arrived at a party with a bowl of chopped liver and a pitcher of hurricane cocktails in sticky pink. We were married for two years: enough time to acquire a KitchenAid mixer but not enough to acquire children, enough time to share a studio apartment but not enough to buy a house. When I moved out, I took the pitcher shaped like an elephant and most of the platters, but I left in such a hurry that half my books remained.Since my divorce, I have begun to issue too many dinner invitations, although my kitchen, shared with three housemates, is cramped, and for months, until a friend intervened with screws, my grandmother’s walnut table wobbled perilously at the slightest touch. Nonetheless, I select recipes and, falsely casual, induce my friends to join me: come over; we’ll make lemon-drop cookies, I say. Sift confectioner’s sugar into a bowl, whisk in lemon juice, add still more sugar to thicken: the blandishments of my loneliness are sweet and acidic, brushed on, carefully, with a fork. Stay for dinner. I’ll make chicken. In solitude, my plate—blue Le Creuset ceramic, a wedding gift—is as empty as my bed.Some months after the divorce, I invited more friends than could fit into my tiny living room for a dinner. I laid out a card table that jutted into the kitchen, arranging folding chairs whose backs knocked the walls and caught at the door’s handle. I made scalloped potatoes. I blanched asparagus. I whacked at slivered almonds with a hardcover book, in an attempt to make a cake that was later described by my guests, not unkindly, as a granola or a brittle. The friends I invited had seen me sob in broad daylight when my husband first left. They had fielded calls at unreasonable hours. In return, I made them avgolemono.When the chicken has simmered for an hour, add a cup of long-grain rice; orzo is more traditionally Greek, but any rice will do. Then comes the trickiest step, tempering the eggs: it’s a magician’s flick of the wrist, the small skill that makes the soup a gift and a secret. Juice two lemons and beat three eggs in a bowl; take a ladleful of hot broth and whisk it into the yellow mixture. Repeat this action, beating in ladle after ladle until your fingertip tells you that the liquid is hot. Then turn off the heat on your pot of broth and pour in the lemon-and-egg; chase it to the far reaches with the whisk, until the broth clouds as suddenly as a summer storm. Don’t let the mixture boil, or the whites will turn to albuminous ribbons, the yolks to rubble, and the lovely color, like a newly painted parlor, will be wrecked. Be careful and be gentle. Shred the chicken’s flesh, salt it, let it slide back into the broth. At the last possible moment, drop a handful of spinach to wilt in the steam.Let the pot feed as many mouths as possible; dip the ladle until it scrapes the bottom clean. When the final guest has left, and you’re doing the dishes, take up the last spoonful, a small gift to yourself. Let the fine, sour taste linger on your tongue.More:Chicken SoupCookingDivorceFamilyMarriageDive into the world of literature with The New Yorker’s weekly fiction newsletter.SubmitMost Popular1.A Reporter at LargeGuantánamo’s Darkest SecretBy Ben Taub2.News DeskSecrecy, Self-Dealing, and Greed at the N.R.A.By Mike Spies3.Letter from Trump’s WashingtonThe Mueller Report Won’t End Trump’s Presidency, But It Sure Makes Him Look BadBy Susan B.

We were the kind of people who arrived at a party with a bowl of chopped liver and a pitcher of hurricane cocktails in sticky pink. We were married for two years: enough time to acquire a KitchenAid mixer but not enough to acquire children, enough time to share a studio apartment but not enough to buy a house. When I moved out, I took the pitcher shaped like an elephant and most of the platters, but I left in such a hurry that half my books remained.Since my divorce, I have begun to issue too many dinner invitations, although my kitchen, shared with three housemates, is cramped, and for months, until a friend intervened with screws, my grandmother’s walnut table wobbled perilously at the slightest touch. Nonetheless, I select recipes and, falsely casual, induce my friends to join me: come over; we’ll make lemon-drop cookies, I say. Sift confectioner’s sugar into a bowl, whisk in lemon juice, add still more sugar to thicken: the blandishments of my loneliness are sweet and acidic, brushed on, carefully, with a fork. Stay for dinner. I’ll make chicken. In solitude, my plate—blue Le Creuset ceramic, a wedding gift—is as empty as my bed.Some months after the divorce, I invited more friends than could fit into my tiny living room for a dinner. I laid out a card table that jutted into the kitchen, arranging folding chairs whose backs knocked the walls and caught at the door’s handle. I made scalloped potatoes. I blanched asparagus. I whacked at slivered almonds with a hardcover book, in an attempt to make a cake that was later described by my guests, not unkindly, as a granola or a brittle. The friends I invited had seen me sob in broad daylight when my husband first left. They had fielded calls at unreasonable hours. In return, I made them avgolemono.When the chicken has simmered for an hour, add a cup of long-grain rice; orzo is more traditionally Greek, but any rice will do. Then comes the trickiest step, tempering the eggs: it’s a magician’s flick of the wrist, the small skill that makes the soup a gift and a secret. Juice two lemons and beat three eggs in a bowl; take a ladleful of hot broth and whisk it into the yellow mixture. Repeat this action, beating in ladle after ladle until your fingertip tells you that the liquid is hot. Then turn off the heat on your pot of broth and pour in the lemon-and-egg; chase it to the far reaches with the whisk, until the broth clouds as suddenly as a summer storm. Don’t let the mixture boil, or the whites will turn to albuminous ribbons, the yolks to rubble, and the lovely color, like a newly painted parlor, will be wrecked. Be careful and be gentle. Shred the chicken’s flesh, salt it, let it slide back into the broth. At the last possible moment, drop a handful of spinach to wilt in the steam.Let the pot feed as many mouths as possible; dip the ladle until it scrapes the bottom clean. When the final guest has left, and you’re doing the dishes, take up the last spoonful, a small gift to yourself. Let the fine, sour taste linger on your tongue.All chicken soups are alike at the start: a dead bird in water, boiling flesh, a billow of steam, grains of salt in the cook’s palm. Growing up, I ate Ashkenazi Jewish chicken soup, with sliced celery and parsnips, flavored with dill in a pouch of cheesecloth. Its weekly appearance at our table heralded the Sabbath, strictly observed in my Orthodox family, which meant a twenty-five-hour pause in labor. During that time, the work in my family was more abstract: loving, playing, making war on one another. By Saturday afternoon, an atlas of purple wine stains decorated the tablecloth.I left Orthodox Judaism when I left home, and I’ve never made a Jewish chicken soup since. When I return to my family’s table, it’s as a prodigal, wisecracking, chain-smoking daughter. In my new, secular life, I have acted like a Roman and stolen my chicken soup from the Greeks. It is called avgolemono: a broth of chicken thickened with whisked egg and lemon and fortified with rice and spinach. The name, Greek for “egg-lemon,” can in Mediterranean cuisine refer to a sauce, a broth, or a thickening agent; some sources say it harks back to the time of Alexander the Great. Other stories say it came to Greece along with Sephardic Jews expelled from Spain in the fifteenth century, who, even in Salonika, called it by its Ladino name, sopa de huevo y limón.I first found a recipe for avgolemono soup when searching for a birthday gift for my mother: I was going to cook up a big meal and serve it by candlelight, stealing a little of the language of romance. I found instructions on the Internet, and I came up with brandy apples, too, deglazed in a scary spout of flame. But foremost was the soup, which I had never tasted before. It was pale at the darkened table, silky, warm. In those days, I wanted to offer something so perfect that it would placate all parental disappointment, something that could garner only praise.In the Bible, the primary text of my religious childhood, the one figure who is given soup as a gift has far more taken from him in return. In Genesis, Esau is hungry; he has hunted all day, and he comes to his brother Jacob’s tent for food. Jacob gives him lentil stew (sometimes translated as pottage, mess, broth), and in exchange the clumsy, ruddy Esau gives up his firstborn rights. “He did eat and drink and got up and went on his way,” the Bible says. “So Esau despised his birthright.” Sometimes a gift is treachery. Sometimes you have to give up your birthright, and turn away from the tastes you knew.At twenty-seven, I have not yet learned to cook for just myself. For seven years, when I cooked at all, I cooked for the man who became my husband when I was twenty-four. At our wedding, the food was good—I don’t remember what we ate, but I remember that we continued eating throughout the toasts. At home in the years that followed, he was impatient with my need to roast a whole chicken; he could do up the thighs so well with oxtail spice or paprika.
