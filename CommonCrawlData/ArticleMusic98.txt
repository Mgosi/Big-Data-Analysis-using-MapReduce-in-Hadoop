Nearly two years after the release of their fourth studio album "Angles," the Strokes are returning with new music. Billboard has confirmed a report that the Strokes' fifth studio album will be released later this year, and that the intended first single is titled "All The Time." On Wednesday night (Jan. 16), Seattle radio station 107.7 The End hinted that they had heard new Strokes music in a post on its Facebook page. "Previewing brand new Strokes 'All the Time' thanks to RCA Records. We'll have to 'leak' this soon. You won't be disappointed… -mike," reads the message. Last June, Billboard was the first to report that Julian Casablancas and co. had logged time at New York's Electric Lady Studios recording their fifth full-length. Although the group's representation denied that a new album was in the works, a source confirmed that the Strokes were holed up with producer Gus Oberg, who was responsible for mixing parts of "Angles." "We have songs that you can tell are gonna be good ones (that) we're all excited to play," guitarist Albert Hammond Jr. told Billboard in 2011, when the group was on the festival circuit supporting "Angles. "I don't know if we're the kind of band that would ever play something new before it came out, just the way the Internet works and people recording it. I think even if we had the whole record done, we wouldn't play it 'til the album was out." "Angles," which was released after a five-year break for the garage-rock mavericks, has sold 221,000 copies since hitting stores in March 2011, according to Nielsen SoundScan.The online extension of Billboard Magazine, billboard.biz is the essential online destination for the music business.Learn More© 2019 Billboard.
