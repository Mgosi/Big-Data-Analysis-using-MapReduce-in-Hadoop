Country rock star Eric Church just surprised members of his fan club with a new album, and he didn’t exactly do it the usual way. Nope, no iTunes, no ZIP file, no Apple Music stream, no BitTorrent bundle. Church sent CDs in the mail.It’s a ten-song album and it’s called Mr. Misunderstood. Members of the Church Choir received it Tuesday (Nov. 3).It’s a very non-traditional way of pulling a Beyoncé, but hey, in all seriousness, if you really are all about your fans, this is a great way to prove it. The album wasn’t dropped into the general public’s consciousness, inviting an arms race of reviews and quick hit takes. At least one fan did eventually upload the entire album to YouTube, but it was pulled down soon after, assuring Mr. Misunderstood would remain a physical album that belonged only to Church superfans, if only for a little longer. Take a deep breath and let the nostalgia soak in.Billboard 200 Chart Moves: Eric Church's 'Outsiders' Hits 1 Million SoldChurch is yet to acknowledge the album via any of his official outlets, so it appears he’s in no rush to tell the world about his little surprise. In other Church news, he’s set to open the CMA Awards tonight, covering Neil Young's “Are You Ready For the Country?” alongside Hank Williams, Jr. Stick with Billboard.com for complete coverage of all the evening’s festivities. The online extension of Billboard Magazine, billboard.biz is the essential online destination for the music business.Learn More© 2019 Billboard.

Church follows up 2014’s LP ‘The Outsiders’ with a most un-2015 trick.

Country rock star Eric Church just surprised members of his fan club with a new album, and he didn’t exactly do it the usual way. Nope, no iTunes, no ZIP file, no Apple Music stream, no BitTorrent bundle. Church sent CDs in the mail.It’s a ten-song album and it’s called Mr. Misunderstood. Members of the Church Choir received it Tuesday (Nov. 3).It’s a very non-traditional way of pulling a Beyoncé, but hey, in all seriousness, if you really are all about your fans, this is a great way to prove it. The album wasn’t dropped into the general public’s consciousness, inviting an arms race of reviews and quick hit takes. At least one fan did eventually upload the entire album to YouTube, but it was pulled down soon after, assuring Mr. Misunderstood would remain a physical album that belonged only to Church superfans, if only for a little longer.
