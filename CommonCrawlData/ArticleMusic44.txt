Welcome to the Billboard Chart Beat Podcast, where each week co-hosts Gary Trust and Trevor Anderson, from the Billboard charts department, discuss why what's on the charts … is on the charts, while also looking at current chart action in a historical context for even greater insights.This week, Jonas Brothers celebrate their first No. 1 song on the Billboard Hot 100, as "Sucker" soars in at the summit. What helped power the trio's long-awaited rule? With the help of JoBros superfan (oh, and Billboard staff writer) Taylor Weatherby, we look at factors from the group's signing to Republic Records to the song's all-star lineup of writers and more.We also welcome special guests Danny Wood, of New Kids on the Block, and Jessie Chris to chat about their new song, "Bodyguard." The ballad, written by Wood, became a duet between the Massachusetts natives after he was inspired upon learning that Chris had visited over 100 schools to help spread an anti-bullying message. (Proceeds of the single will go to further that mission; meanwhile, Wood's solo music has long benefitted the Remember Betty foundation, which, named in honor of his late mother, provides financial support to breast cancer patients and survivors).

With Jonas Brothers atop the Hot 100 and New Kids marking the 30th anniversary of their first Billboard 200 No. 1 album Hangin' Tough with a March 8 deluxe reissue and the upcoming Mixtape Tour, Wood marvels at boy bands' longevity. Looking back on the group's reunion in 2008 after over a decade apart, he says, "We didn't know if this would last. That was my only worry. I had no clue who was going to buy tickets, who was going to show up at the shows. That spark we lit back in 1988 … it stuck with the fans."As you get older, things slow down a little bit," he says. "You learn to appreciate things more. I'm really proud we got to have a second chance."Enjoy the latest Billboard Chart Beat Podcast and check back for additional upcoming episodes with artists, label executives, radio programmers and personalities, songwriters, producers and more.

Welcome to the Billboard Chart Beat Podcast, where each week co-hosts Gary Trust and Trevor Anderson, from the Billboard charts department, discuss why what's on the charts … is on the charts, while also looking at current chart action in a historical context for even greater insights.This week, Jonas Brothers celebrate their first No. 1 song on the Billboard Hot 100, as "Sucker" soars in at the summit. What helped power the trio's long-awaited rule? With the help of JoBros superfan (oh, and Billboard staff writer) Taylor Weatherby, we look at factors from the group's signing to Republic Records to the song's all-star lineup of writers and more.We also welcome special guests Danny Wood, of New Kids on the Block, and Jessie Chris to chat about their new song, "Bodyguard." The ballad, written by Wood, became a duet between the Massachusetts natives after he was inspired upon learning that Chris had visited over 100 schools to help spread an anti-bullying message.
