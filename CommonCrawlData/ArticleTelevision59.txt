While it seemed like Fargo’s first season had one of the best casts on TV, Season 2 is already looking like it’ll eclipse it. (Though the absence of Alison Tolman will definitely be a mark against.) The newest actor added to the cast is the grooviest one yet, as Bruce Campbell is set to take on the role of future U.S. President Ronald Reagan. Hopefully this will precede Campbell’s actual run for president in 2016 or 2020. Whenever, really.

Season 2 of Fargo will take place in the late 1970s, and Campbell’s version of Reagan will be on his first campaign for the presidency, which will take him through Fargo at some point. He’s been confirmed by FX CEO John Landgraf to meet up with other characters during that journey. According to TV Line, though, it’s not clear if he’ll be directly reteaming with his former Burn Notice co-star Jeremy Donovan, who will be recurring in this next season, but one can definitely hope that’ll be the case.

If you need a brief visual check on how closely the two men resemble each other, here you go. Just picture microphones in front of Campbell. Or a boomstick in Regan’s hands.



Fargo’s prequel season will follow a younger Lou Solverson, played by Patrick Wilson, who will be trying to get his life in order as a cop in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, in his years after serving in Vietnam. Some kind of horrible incident happens with his wife Betsy, as played by How I Met Your Mother’s Cristin Milloti, which was referred to in the first season. The rest of this ridiculously awesome cast includes Ted Danson, Jean Smart, Kirsten Dunst, Jesse Plemons, Kieran Culkin, Nick Offerman, Brad Garrett, Keir O’Donnell, Bokeem Woodbine, Angus Simpson, Rachel Keller, and Michael Hogan. There’s no room for errors here.

Campbell is already set to make a huge TV comeback – if returning after two years can be considered a comeback – for Sam Raimi’s small screen return to his horror creation Ash vs. Evil Dead for Starz. Having Campbell play Reagan and then Ash Williams in the span of the same year sounds like it’s too good to be true, but it isn’t. (Not to mention his role as Santa Claus in The Librarians.) If you’ll recall, Campbell also showed up in the Coen brothers’ film Fargo, by way of a television.



Fargo’s 10-episode Season 2 is set to debut this fall on FX.

While it seemed like Fargo’s first season had one of the best casts on TV, Season 2 is already looking like it’ll eclipse it. (Though the absence of Alison Tolman will definitely be a mark against.) The newest actor added to the cast is the grooviest one yet, as Bruce Campbell is set to take on the role of future U.S. President Ronald Reagan. Hopefully this will precede Campbell’s actual run for president in 2016 or 2020. Whenever, really.

Season 2 of Fargo will take place in the late 1970s, and Campbell’s version of Reagan will be on his first campaign for the presidency, which will take him through Fargo at some point. He’s been confirmed by FX CEO John Landgraf to meet up with other characters during that journey. According to TV Line, though, it’s not clear if he’ll be directly reteaming with his former Burn Notice co-star Jeremy Donovan, who will be recurring in this next season, but one can definitely hope that’ll be the case.

If you need a brief visual check on how closely the two men resemble each other, here you go. Just picture microphones in front of Campbell. Or a boomstick in Regan’s hands.



Fargo’s prequel season will follow a younger Lou Solverson, played by Patrick Wilson, who will be trying to get his life in order as a cop in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, in his years after serving in Vietnam. Some kind of horrible incident happens with his wife Betsy, as played by How I Met Your Mother’s Cristin Milloti, which was referred to in the first season. The rest of this ridiculously awesome cast includes Ted Danson, Jean Smart, Kirsten Dunst, Jesse Plemons, Kieran Culkin, Nick Offerman, Brad Garrett, Keir O’Donnell, Bokeem Woodbine, Angus Simpson, Rachel Keller, and Michael Hogan. There’s no room for errors here.

Campbell is already set to make a huge TV comeback – if returning after two years can be considered a comeback – for Sam Raimi’s small screen return to his horror creation Ash vs. Evil Dead for Starz. Having Campbell play Reagan and then Ash Williams in the span of the same year sounds like it’s too good to be true, but it isn’t. (Not to mention his role as Santa Claus in The Librarians.) If you’ll recall, Campbell also showed up in the Coen brothers’ film Fargo, by way of a television.



Fargo’s 10-episode Season 2 is set to debut this fall on FX.

While it seemed like Fargo’s first season had one of the best casts on TV, Season 2 is already looking like it’ll eclipse it. (Though the absence of Alison Tolman will definitely be a mark against.) The newest actor added to the cast is the grooviest one yet, as Bruce Campbell is set to take on the role of future U.S. President Ronald Reagan. Hopefully this will precede Campbell’s actual run for president in 2016 or 2020. Whenever, really.

Season 2 of Fargo will take place in the late 1970s, and Campbell’s version of Reagan will be on his first campaign for the presidency, which will take him through Fargo at some point. He’s been confirmed by FX CEO John Landgraf to meet up with other characters during that journey. According to TV Line, though, it’s not clear if he’ll be directly reteaming with his former Burn Notice co-star Jeremy Donovan, who will be recurring in this next season, but one can definitely hope that’ll be the case.

If you need a brief visual check on how closely the two men resemble each other, here you go. Just picture microphones in front of Campbell. Or a boomstick in Regan’s hands.



Fargo’s prequel season will follow a younger Lou Solverson, played by Patrick Wilson, who will be trying to get his life in order as a cop in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, in his years after serving in Vietnam.
