Sparta’s bravest soldiers come home later this year in the blockbuster comic book adaptation 300. To help promote what already looks like a killer release (available in single-disc, or double-disc DVD, Blu-Ray, and HD DVD), Warner Home Video is giving you the chance to prove your own worth and battle it out against other fans to become part of the 300.

The contest, located at www.jointhe300.com, combines social networking and your own creativity and knowledge as you compete in different tasks to get 300 points and get in the running for some awesome prizes ranging from posters and DVDs to a trip to San Diego Comic-Con and even a chance to visit the set of Zach Snyder’s next film: Watchmen.

Just for registering with the contest you’ll be eligible for random prizes like DVDs, iPod shuffles, and mini-posters signed by Snyder. So even if you’re like that little traitorous hunchback figure in the movie you can possibly win something. To really prove your worth as a Spartan, however, you have to compete. The competitors will be narrowed down to a final two, who will win the Comic-Con trip. Those two will then go heads up in a new contest for the chance to win that Watchmen set visit.

Show your passion for 300 and sign up for the contest today at www.jointhe300.com. Then check out the movie on DVD, HD DVD, and Blu-ray on July 31st.

Sparta’s bravest soldiers come home later this year in the blockbuster comic book adaptation 300. To help promote what already looks like a killer release (available in single-disc, or double-disc DVD, Blu-Ray, and HD DVD), Warner Home Video is giving you the chance to prove your own worth and battle it out against other fans to become part of the 300.

The contest, located at www.jointhe300.com, combines social networking and your own creativity and knowledge as you compete in different tasks to get 300 points and get in the running for some awesome prizes ranging from posters and DVDs to a trip to San Diego Comic-Con and even a chance to visit the set of Zach Snyder’s next film: Watchmen.

Just for registering with the contest you’ll be eligible for random prizes like DVDs, iPod shuffles, and mini-posters signed by Snyder. So even if you’re like that little traitorous hunchback figure in the movie you can possibly win something. To really prove your worth as a Spartan, however, you have to compete. The competitors will be narrowed down to a final two, who will win the Comic-Con trip. Those two will then go heads up in a new contest for the chance to win that Watchmen set visit.

Show your passion for 300 and sign up for the contest today at www.jointhe300.com. Then check out the movie on DVD, HD DVD, and Blu-ray on July 31st.
