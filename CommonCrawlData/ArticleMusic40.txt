Peace and Love."  In the studio again with the great Steve Lukather what a guy peace and Love. --✌️--------‍♀️--------☮️ pic.twitter.com/dbgs4teP4xRingo's most recent album, Give More Love, peaked at No. 128 on the Billboard 200 in October 2017.  Recently, he made news when it was announced he played drums on Jenny Lewis' “Heads Gonna Roll" for her new album On the Line, to be released this week. He was also among those paying tribute to legendary drummer Hal Blaine after his recent passing.Ringo and his All-Starr Band will be touring this year, starting March 21 in Funner, Calif., followed by nine shows in April in Japan. He'll be back performing in Canada and the U.S. starting Aug. 1.
