Dungeons & Dragons has been a gaming phenomena since the 1970s, allowing players to create their own character and adventure in an RPG fantasy world with friends. However, the game yet to experience any true cinematic success. There was a movie adaptation that came out in 2000, but it was received poorly, and its two direct-to-DVD sequels fared even worse. Now Warner Bros is setting out to give Dungeons & Dragons another chance at the big screen, and they may have found the new movie's lead in Divergent actor Ansel Elgort.
According to a new Deadline report, Elgort is in early negotiations to star in the new Dungeons & Dragons movie. No deal has been officially worked out, but if he does join, he would be the movie's first official actor. Vin Diesel previously expressed interest in joining if the story was done right, and considering how much he loves the game, his presence would undoubtedly be welcome both as a movie star and fan. Goosebumps' Rob Letterman is directing the feature, while The Conjuring 2's David Leslie Johnson penned the script.
The Dungeons & Dragons movie will follow a warrior and his band of mystical creatures as they go on a dangerous journey to find a legendary treasure. That sounds about right for a theatrical adaptation, and while elements like races, weapons and spells will undoubtedly remain intact, the movie has the creative freedom to go wherever it wants to story-wise, just like the games themselves. Dungeons & Dragons was involved in a lengthy lawsuit over rights issues, but that was finally resolved last year. The Deadline report also mentions that the movie has become a "top priority" for Warner Bros, as the studio is seeking new franchises to add to their slate, which already includes the DC Extended Universe and Harry Potter/Fantastic Beasts series.
Ansel Elgort has been a rising star in Hollywood over the last three years. The young adult crowd will recognize him as Caleb Prior in the Divergent movies, and his other credits include the Carrie remake and The Fault in Our Stars. His upcoming movies include November Criminals and Billionaire Boys Club, and at one point, he was reportedly in the running to play young Han Solo in the 2018 Star Wars spinoff movie centered around the smuggler, but that honor now belongs to Alden Ehrenreich. Assuming this Dungeons & Dragons deal goes through, this will most certainly propel Elgort to a new level of fame.
Dungeons & Dragons hasn't been assigned a release date yet, but we'll keep you apprised of its progress as more news comes in. In the meantime, let us know what you think of Ansel Elgort possibly joining the movie in the comments below.

Dungeons & Dragons hasn't been assigned a release date yet, but we'll keep you apprised of its progress as more news comes in. In the meantime, let us know what you think of Ansel Elgort possibly joining the movie in the comments below.

Dungeons & Dragons has been a gaming phenomena since the 1970s, allowing players to create their own character and adventure in an RPG fantasy world with friends. However, the game yet to experience any true cinematic success. There was a movie adaptation that came out in 2000, but it was received poorly, and its two direct-to-DVD sequels fared even worse. Now Warner Bros is setting out to give Dungeons & Dragons another chance at the big screen, and they may have found the new movie's lead in Divergent actor Ansel Elgort.
According to a new Deadline report, Elgort is in early negotiations to star in the new Dungeons & Dragons movie. No deal has been officially worked out, but if he does join, he would be the movie's first official actor. Vin Diesel previously expressed interest in joining if the story was done right, and considering how much he loves the game, his presence would undoubtedly be welcome both as a movie star and fan. Goosebumps' Rob Letterman is directing the feature, while The Conjuring 2's David Leslie Johnson penned the script.
The Dungeons & Dragons movie will follow a warrior and his band of mystical creatures as they go on a dangerous journey to find a legendary treasure. That sounds about right for a theatrical adaptation, and while elements like races, weapons and spells will undoubtedly remain intact, the movie has the creative freedom to go wherever it wants to story-wise, just like the games themselves. Dungeons & Dragons was involved in a lengthy lawsuit over rights issues, but that was finally resolved last year. The Deadline report also mentions that the movie has become a "top priority" for Warner Bros, as the studio is seeking new franchises to add to their slate, which already includes the DC Extended Universe and Harry Potter/Fantastic Beasts series.
Ansel Elgort has been a rising star in Hollywood over the last three years. The young adult crowd will recognize him as Caleb Prior in the Divergent movies, and his other credits include the Carrie remake and The Fault in Our Stars. His upcoming movies include November Criminals and Billionaire Boys Club, and at one point, he was reportedly in the running to play young Han Solo in the 2018 Star Wars spinoff movie centered around the smuggler, but that honor now belongs to Alden Ehrenreich. Assuming this Dungeons & Dragons deal goes through, this will most certainly propel Elgort to a new level of fame.
Dungeons & Dragons hasn't been assigned a release date yet, but we'll keep you apprised of its progress as more news comes in. In the meantime, let us know what you think of Ansel Elgort possibly joining the movie in the comments below.
