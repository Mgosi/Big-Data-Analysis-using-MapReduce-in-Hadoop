PnB Rock kicked off the rollout of what is being billed as his debut album following 2017's Catch These Vibes with Trapstar Turnt Popstar on Thursday (March 21). The Philly-bred artist grabbed Lil Skies to guest for the tender first single "I Like Girls," which premiered as Zane Lowe's World Record on Beats 1."I like girls who like girls," PnB croons through the melodic chorus over Hitmaka's smooth production. "It's pretty much universal, you know what I'm saying? Everybody like girls," Rock told Lowe of the track's meaning. The 27-year-old was also very complimentary of Skies' ability in the booth. "He's not just putting words together that don't make [any] sense, he's using words that people really don't really normally use as a rapper. He's got a nice vocabulary," the Atlantic Records signee said.PnB Rock gave away a few suprises planned for Trapstar Turnt Popstar, as Tee Grizzley, Quavo and a posthumous XXXTentacion will appear on the effort. "I have two songs that haven't been released by me and XXX, and one of them is the one that made the album," he explained. "It was [for] sentimental reasons, but at the same time, it's timeless music. So I know if I put this song out five years down the line, it's still gonna be the same vibe."
