Subscribe To Is The Halo TV Series Ever Happening? Here’s What Xbox’s Exec Says UpdatesEver since Halo first hit the Xbox and ushered in a new era of first-person shooters, people have been asking for a movie or TV show. It seemed like Microsoft was willing to answer that call, with years of rumors and multiple Halo projects in development. Most of these were either untrue or never saw the light of day, but considering what a fixture Halo was in the video game community, people still held out hope. Now Phil Spencer, the Head of Xbox, has revealed the state of the Halo TV show development with just one little word.@DMC_Ryan Alive.Coming straight from Phil Spencer's Twitter account, a Halo TV series is still in development; they haven't given up just yet. In 2013 it was announced that a Halo TV series was in development at Showtime with Steven Spielberg executive producing. This is most likely the series that's still alive, but we've barely heard anything about it in these past three years. Maybe more news is coming soon, but in the meantime fans will simply have to hold out knowing that it may happen eventually.Halo is a series of video games that follow a future intergalactic war between humanity and a group of aliens known as the Covenant. The main series follows the Master Chief, one of the last remaining subjects of a super soldier program who sets out to end the war for good.The video game series has spawned several spin-off games and novels. TV shows and a movie based on the Halo property have been in development for a long time, with little actually coming to fruition. Notable filmmakers like Neill Blomkamp and Peter Jackson were once attached to a Halo movie before the project stalled and the rights reverted back to Microsoft. Perhaps the most notable product to be made is the miniseries/film Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn, which follows a young cadet in the early days of the Human-Covenant War. At the time of this writing it's still available on Netflix, so check it out if you have the chance.As to what this still developing TV show will be about, there's no shortage of stories in the Halo universe. The show could be a straight adaptation of the main video game series, following Master Chief through Halo 3 and beyond. It could also take inspiration from one of the many novels the games have spawned. Hell, it could even be about entirely original characters in a series created from scratch for TV.It sounds like we could be getting some more Halo related news in the future, so make sure to keep it here at Cinema Blend and we'll keep you updated as new information becomes available.

Ever since Halo first hit the Xbox and ushered in a new era of first-person shooters, people have been asking for a movie or TV show. It seemed like Microsoft was willing to answer that call, with years of rumors and multiple Halo projects in development. Most of these were either untrue or never saw the light of day, but considering what a fixture Halo was in the video game community, people still held out hope. Now Phil Spencer, the Head of Xbox, has revealed the state of the Halo TV show development with just one little word.

Coming straight from Phil Spencer's Twitter account, a Halo TV series is still in development; they haven't given up just yet. In 2013 it was announced that a Halo TV series was in development at Showtime with Steven Spielberg executive producing. This is most likely the series that's still alive, but we've barely heard anything about it in these past three years. Maybe more news is coming soon, but in the meantime fans will simply have to hold out knowing that it may happen eventually.
Halo is a series of video games that follow a future intergalactic war between humanity and a group of aliens known as the Covenant. The main series follows the Master Chief, one of the last remaining subjects of a super soldier program who sets out to end the war for good.
The video game series has spawned several spin-off games and novels. TV shows and a movie based on the Halo property have been in development for a long time, with little actually coming to fruition. Notable filmmakers like Neill Blomkamp and Peter Jackson were once attached to a Halo movie before the project stalled and the rights reverted back to Microsoft. Perhaps the most notable product to be made is the miniseries/film Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn, which follows a young cadet in the early days of the Human-Covenant War. At the time of this writing it's still available on Netflix, so check it out if you have the chance.
As to what this still developing TV show will be about, there's no shortage of stories in the Halo universe. The show could be a straight adaptation of the main video game series, following Master Chief through Halo 3 and beyond. It could also take inspiration from one of the many novels the games have spawned. Hell, it could even be about entirely original characters in a series created from scratch for TV.
It sounds like we could be getting some more Halo related news in the future, so make sure to keep it here at Cinema Blend and we'll keep you updated as new information becomes available.

Ever since Halo first hit the Xbox and ushered in a new era of first-person shooters, people have been asking for a movie or TV show. It seemed like Microsoft was willing to answer that call, with years of rumors and multiple Halo projects in development. Most of these were either untrue or never saw the light of day, but considering what a fixture Halo was in the video game community, people still held out hope. Now Phil Spencer, the Head of Xbox, has revealed the state of the Halo TV show development with just one little word.

Coming straight from Phil Spencer's Twitter account, a Halo TV series is still in development; they haven't given up just yet. In 2013 it was announced that a Halo TV series was in development at Showtime with Steven Spielberg executive producing. This is most likely the series that's still alive, but we've barely heard anything about it in these past three years. Maybe more news is coming soon, but in the meantime fans will simply have to hold out knowing that it may happen eventually.
Halo is a series of video games that follow a future intergalactic war between humanity and a group of aliens known as the Covenant. The main series follows the Master Chief, one of the last remaining subjects of a super soldier program who sets out to end the war for good.
The video game series has spawned several spin-off games and novels. TV shows and a movie based on the Halo property have been in development for a long time, with little actually coming to fruition. Notable filmmakers like Neill Blomkamp and Peter Jackson were once attached to a Halo movie before the project stalled and the rights reverted back to Microsoft. Perhaps the most notable product to be made is the miniseries/film Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn, which follows a young cadet in the early days of the Human-Covenant War. At the time of this writing it's still available on Netflix, so check it out if you have the chance.
As to what this still developing TV show will be about, there's no shortage of stories in the Halo universe. The show could be a straight adaptation of the main video game series, following Master Chief through Halo 3 and beyond. It could also take inspiration from one of the many novels the games have spawned. Hell, it could even be about entirely original characters in a series created from scratch for TV.
It sounds like we could be getting some more Halo related news in the future, so make sure to keep it here at Cinema Blend and we'll keep you updated as new information becomes available.
