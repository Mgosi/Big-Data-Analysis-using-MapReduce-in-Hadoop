Netflix sure doesn’t waste any time when it knows what it wants. Though it only premiered on April 1, The Ranch, a sitcom starring Ashton Kutcher and Sam Elliot, has already been renewed for Season 2. The Ranch will have new episodes arrive on the streaming service giant at some point next year in 2017.


It’s official: Season 2 of @TheRanchNetflix, coming 2017!https://t.co/a582aydDgy
— ashton kutcher (@aplusk) April 29, 2016


The announcement comes from Ashton Kutcher’s Twitter account, where he posted a video revealing the news. He appeared alongside co-stars Danny Masterson and Sam Elliot, where the actors revealed that more episodes for the sitcom were on the way.

The Ranch has something of a unique episode model by Netflix standards. On April 1, the show premiered 10 episodes of Season 1. As the Twitter video reveals, there will be 10 more new episodes premiering in the fall that will conclude Season 1 before Season 2 kicks off sometime in 2017. This differs from Netflix’s usual model of releasing every episode at once for people to watch to their hearts content. The Ranch works more like a network sitcom, in the sense that it takes a mid-season break before coming back. This could prove to be a good model for Netflix users who don’t like the long wait between the seasons of the streaming service's popular shows.

The Ranch is a sitcom starring former That 70’s Show co-stars Ashton Kutcher and Danny Masterson. Ashton kutcher plays a semi-pro football player who returns home to help run the family ranch with his older brother (Danny Masterson) and his father (Sam Elliot). The show received fairly mixed reviews when it premiered and currently has a 53% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Despite this, The Ranch seems to have gained a strong fan base that are excited to see more episodes of the sitcom- if the reaction on Twitter is anything to go by.

 
This renewal is just one of many from the streaming giant’s original content. It was recently announced that Netflix would be producing a Punisher spin-off series from Daredevil, as well as renewing a sequel series to the cult classic film, Wet Hot American Summer, and a new adaptation of Watership Down starring John Boyega and James McAvoy arriving in the future. There are also new seasons of Fuller House and F is for Family on the way.

10 more episodes for Season 1 of The Ranch will arrive in the fall with Season 2 following in 2017. Stay tuned for more updates and official premiere dates for The Ranch.

The announcement comes from Ashton Kutcher’s Twitter account, where he posted a video revealing the news. He appeared alongside co-stars Danny Masterson and Sam Elliot, where the actors revealed that more episodes for the sitcom were on the way.

The Ranch has something of a unique episode model by Netflix standards. On April 1, the show premiered 10 episodes of Season 1. As the Twitter video reveals, there will be 10 more new episodes premiering in the fall that will conclude Season 1 before Season 2 kicks off sometime in 2017. This differs from Netflix’s usual model of releasing every episode at once for people to watch to their hearts content. The Ranch works more like a network sitcom, in the sense that it takes a mid-season break before coming back. This could prove to be a good model for Netflix users who don’t like the long wait between the seasons of the streaming service's popular shows.

The Ranch is a sitcom starring former That 70’s Show co-stars Ashton Kutcher and Danny Masterson. Ashton kutcher plays a semi-pro football player who returns home to help run the family ranch with his older brother (Danny Masterson) and his father (Sam Elliot). The show received fairly mixed reviews when it premiered and currently has a 53% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Despite this, The Ranch seems to have gained a strong fan base that are excited to see more episodes of the sitcom- if the reaction on Twitter is anything to go by.

 
This renewal is just one of many from the streaming giant’s original content. It was recently announced that Netflix would be producing a Punisher spin-off series from Daredevil, as well as renewing a sequel series to the cult classic film, Wet Hot American Summer, and a new adaptation of Watership Down starring John Boyega and James McAvoy arriving in the future. There are also new seasons of Fuller House and F is for Family on the way.

10 more episodes for Season 1 of The Ranch will arrive in the fall with Season 2 following in 2017. Stay tuned for more updates and official premiere dates for The Ranch.
