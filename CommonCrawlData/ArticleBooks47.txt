By Philip GourevitchMay 27, 2017Denis Johnson’s work throbbed with his irreducibly American voice, idiomatically vivid, veering between hardboiled banter and hyperacute physical and emotional immediacy.Denis Johnson’s first and most perfectly realized novel, “Angels,” was the first novel I ever bought new, in hardcover. This was in 1983, in Ithaca, New York, the first wet, yellow week of upstate October. I was twenty-one, a college dropout, working as a bartender in support of the claim that I was writing my own first novel. Some days, the writing didn’t happen. On that day in October, I gave up early, midmorning, and went wandering, and wound up in a bookstore, and there was “Angels,” in a display of début fiction. Its cover showed a charcoal-black desert landscape split by lightning, with the title in hot red type. It was a good-looking cover. How else can you judge a book that you haven’t read, much less heard of? I picked it up and started reading:In the Oakland Greyhound, all the people were dwarves, and they pushed and shoved to get on the bus, even cutting in ahead of the two nuns, who were there first. The two nuns smiled sweetly at Miranda and Baby Ellen and played I-see-you behind their fingers when they’d taken their seats. But Jamie could sense that they found her make-up too thick, her pants too tight. They knew she was leaving her husband, and figured she’d turn for a living to whoring.I flipped to the inside of the back cover and looked at the author: young guy, black curly hair, expression alive and engaged, kind of amused but far away, too, unaware of the camera, in another dimension. I kept reading. On the third page, there was a paragraph that went like this:She fed Baby Ellen her orange juice and watched the sun as it moved into prominence above the dead cornfields in Indiana, the light striking her face painfully as it ticked over the frozen pools and the rows of broken stalks glazed with ice. Her husband angrily sold stereophonic components for a living. He brooded on his life, and it grew on him until he was rattling around inside of it. Why couldn’t she just be thankful to him, he always wanted to know, since he was losing track of what he wanted just so she could have everything she wanted? Couldn’t she see how everything kept happening? It was just—he pounded his fist on the wall so the small trailer shook—one moment goes to the next . . . He choked her close to death twice, frantic to think she couldn’t understand his complaint. And she couldn’t.I read a few more pages, then bought the book and carried it home, to my chair, where I reëntered it and did not leave until I had finished it, six or seven hours of astonishing drama, and violence, and darkly dazzling, hyper-precise, and, at the same time, wailing prose later. Then I looked again at the author photo. Who was this guy? Who wrote this language that carried traces of many writers I’d read before but was its own world entirely? If this was his first book, he must want to hear how good it is. The bio beneath his photo said he lived on Cape Cod. I picked up the phone and called information. I dialled the number the operator gave me, a woman answered, and when I said his name, she asked who was calling, and I said, “A reader.”I had the impression, when I hung up the phone four or five minutes later, that he was wary at first, as if he could hear that I didn’t know what I wanted from him, and figured I must be a head case and he couldn’t get off the phone fast enough. Then, as he relaxed and became friendly, it occurred to me that he was right, I didn’t know what I wanted from him, and really must be a head case, and I couldn’t get off the phone fast enough. The only thing that he said that I remember exactly was when I asked him how long it had taken to write the book. He asked me if I was a writer, and I said that that remained to be seen. Then he answered my question: “Twelve years,” he said.Later that night, I told a friend about my strange phone call, and when I got to the bit about twelve years, I said, “You see, it’s hopeless.” But that wasn’t really what I felt, and I knew it. What I had felt when I hung up the phone was that I had got what I wanted. What I felt was: it was worth it.Johnson, who died this week, at the age of sixty-seven, started out as a poet, and had published his first book of verse when he was nineteen, then spent much of the next decade in the grip of fierce addictions. But once he started publishing again, he made a regular habit of it, producing new books—novels mostly, but also collections of stories and poems and magazine reportage—steadily for the rest of his life. He was an uneven writer, but even his most forgettable work throbbed with his irreducibly American voice, idiomatically vivid, veering between hardboiled banter and hyperacute physical and emotional immediacy—the banter often darkly comic, the description darkly ecstatic, observation so keen and compressed and so idiosyncratic that in bursts of just a few short sentences it could achieve a visionary quality.He liked to play off the edges of genre, spy thrillers, noir, even science fiction—as in his haunting second novel, “Fiskadoro,” which unfolds in a time after nuclear devastation in a place like the Florida Keys. But, whether Johnson was retreading the footsteps of Robert Stone and Graham Greene in the wreckage of Latin American or African revolutions, or of America’s war in Vietnam, or drifting like an unlaid ghost back and forth across the American home front, his fictions rode from book to book on the shoulders of an ever-growing cast of self-dramatizing miscreants—men of schemes and scams, in the grip of unwholesome appetites, brazen but rarely honorable, self-seeking but not self-aware, largely indifferent to cause and effect, defined chiefly by their derelictions and delusions, their missteps and misjudgments, possessed of a seemingly bottomless attraction to bad and violent situations and a limitless capacity for making them worse—in short, men roughly as entertaining on the page as they would surely be repellent in person.Johnson’s own fictional surrogate, the lowlife junky narrator of his most autobiographical and most popular book, “Jesus’ Son,” is named Fuckhead. “It’s a name that’s going to stick,” a fellow addict tells him. “ ‘Fuckhead’ is gonna ride you to your grave.” And it’s true. The name straddles the character like a slapstick fate. It tells you about Johnson, too: he’s harsh and he’s funny, and he’s always swinging between hardboiled and hallucinatory. Fuckhead, the self-poisoner, is a catastrophe, but an ecstatic catastrophe, at once blinded and visionary, spiritually craving and morally craven, a more or less totally hopeless misadventurer, except insofar as he’s not dead yet, which makes him prone to that wild kind of hope that another of Johnson’s antiheroes (a death-row prisoner in “Angels”) describes in the poem “Talking Richard Clay Wilson Blues, by Richard Clay Wilson”:I am not happy. Disappointmentlights its stupid fire in my heart,but two days a week I staffthe Max Security laundry above the worldon the seventh level, looking at two long roadsout there that go to a couple of towns.Young girls accelerating through the intersectionmake me want to live forever,they make me think of the grand things,of wars and extremely white, quiet light that never dies.Fuckhead says things like this: “The travelling salesman had fed me pills that made the linings of my veins feel scraped out. My jaw ached. I knew every raindrop by its name. I sensed everything before it happened.” This is in a story called “Car-Crash While Hitchhiking,” and when the crash happens, and he’s at the hospital with what’s left of the family whose car he was in, he says, “Down the hall came the wife. She was glorious, burning. She didn’t know yet that her husband was dead. We knew. That’s what gave her such power over us.” And when she learns that she’s a widow, what Fuckhead says is, “What a pair of lungs! She shrieked as I imagined an eagle would shriek. It felt wonderful to be alive to hear it! I’ve gone looking for that feeling everywhere.”Another time, he and his buddy Jack Hotel, who’s out on bail while standing trial for armed robbery, drink through the night, and when morning finds them they steal a Social Security check from a dead man’s mail, cash it, buy some heroin, split it, and go their separate ways. Fuckhead barely survives an overdose, but he’s not alarmed. No, he’s enraptured by the near miss: “I was overjoyed not to be dead. Generally the closest I ever came to wondering about the meaning of it all was to consider that I must be the victim of a joke. There was no touching the hem of mystery, no little occasion when any of us thought—well, speaking for myself only, I suppose—that our lungs were filled with light, or anything like that. I had a moment’s glory that night.” Meanwhile, across town, Hotel overdoses, too. Some friends of Fuckhead’s are there with him, and they watch over him—until they lose interest, and Hotel dies.Johnson said that “Jesus’ Son” was drawn from memory. “Almost everything in there actually happened to someone I know or heard about,” he told the Times. In his sober, hard-writing decades, he identified as a Christian, and questions of faith, usually in crisis, riddle his work. But it is impossible to detect any coherent sense of the writer’s religiosity from the fallen people in the fallen worlds of his books. What, I always wondered, did he believe in in his own life that was unavailable to his characters? I never had another conversation with Johnson after our phone call, so I never had occasion to ask.Fuckhead is not someone you’re supposed to respond to as good or bad or even in between in any conventional sense. He is the American expression of what the Russians call a holy fool, a fleshing out of William Carlos Williams’s declamation, “The pure products of America go crazy.” He’s someone you have to respond to the way you respond to the deepest, weirdest, truest voices of rock and roll: you don’t want to be him, or even—if you’re at least halfway sane—to be with him; you just want to hear him tell it, because when he does everything feels heightened.Philip Gourevitch has been a regular contributor to The New Yorker since 1995 and a staff writer since 1997.Dive into the world of literature with The New Yorker’s weekly fiction newsletter.By Ben TaubBy Mike SpiesBy Susan B.

What, I always wondered, did he believe in in his own life that was unavailable to his characters? I never had another conversation with Johnson after our phone call, so I never had occasion to ask.Fuckhead is not someone you’re supposed to respond to as good or bad or even in between in any conventional sense. He is the American expression of what the Russians call a holy fool, a fleshing out of William Carlos Williams’s declamation, “The pure products of America go crazy.” He’s someone you have to respond to the way you respond to the deepest, weirdest, truest voices of rock and roll: you don’t want to be him, or even—if you’re at least halfway sane—to be with him; you just want to hear him tell it, because when he does everything feels heightened.Philip Gourevitch has been a regular contributor to The New Yorker since 1995 and a staff writer since 1997.Read more »More:Denis JohnsonFictionPoetrypostscriptDive into the world of literature with The New Yorker’s weekly fiction newsletter.SubmitMost Popular1.A Reporter at LargeGuantánamo’s Darkest SecretBy Ben Taub2.News DeskSecrecy, Self-Dealing, and Greed at the N.R.A.By Mike Spies3.Letter from Trump’s WashingtonThe Mueller Report Won’t End Trump’s Presidency, But It Sure Makes Him Look BadBy Susan B.

This was in 1983, in Ithaca, New York, the first wet, yellow week of upstate October. I was twenty-one, a college dropout, working as a bartender in support of the claim that I was writing my own first novel. Some days, the writing didn’t happen. On that day in October, I gave up early, midmorning, and went wandering, and wound up in a bookstore, and there was “Angels,” in a display of début fiction. Its cover showed a charcoal-black desert landscape split by lightning, with the title in hot red type. It was a good-looking cover. How else can you judge a book that you haven’t read, much less heard of? I picked it up and started reading:In the Oakland Greyhound, all the people were dwarves, and they pushed and shoved to get on the bus, even cutting in ahead of the two nuns, who were there first. The two nuns smiled sweetly at Miranda and Baby Ellen and played I-see-you behind their fingers when they’d taken their seats. But Jamie could sense that they found her make-up too thick, her pants too tight. They knew she was leaving her husband, and figured she’d turn for a living to whoring.I flipped to the inside of the back cover and looked at the author: young guy, black curly hair, expression alive and engaged, kind of amused but far away, too, unaware of the camera, in another dimension. I kept reading. On the third page, there was a paragraph that went like this:She fed Baby Ellen her orange juice and watched the sun as it moved into prominence above the dead cornfields in Indiana, the light striking her face painfully as it ticked over the frozen pools and the rows of broken stalks glazed with ice. Her husband angrily sold stereophonic components for a living. He brooded on his life, and it grew on him until he was rattling around inside of it. Why couldn’t she just be thankful to him, he always wanted to know, since he was losing track of what he wanted just so she could have everything she wanted? Couldn’t she see how everything kept happening? It was just—he pounded his fist on the wall so the small trailer shook—one moment goes to the next . . . He choked her close to death twice, frantic to think she couldn’t understand his complaint. And she couldn’t.I read a few more pages, then bought the book and carried it home, to my chair, where I reëntered it and did not leave until I had finished it, six or seven hours of astonishing drama, and violence, and darkly dazzling, hyper-precise, and, at the same time, wailing prose later. Then I looked again at the author photo. Who was this guy? Who wrote this language that carried traces of many writers I’d read before but was its own world entirely? If this was his first book, he must want to hear how good it is. The bio beneath his photo said he lived on Cape Cod. I picked up the phone and called information. I dialled the number the operator gave me, a woman answered, and when I said his name, she asked who was calling, and I said, “A reader.”I had the impression, when I hung up the phone four or five minutes later, that he was wary at first, as if he could hear that I didn’t know what I wanted from him, and figured I must be a head case and he couldn’t get off the phone fast enough. Then, as he relaxed and became friendly, it occurred to me that he was right, I didn’t know what I wanted from him, and really must be a head case, and I couldn’t get off the phone fast enough. The only thing that he said that I remember exactly was when I asked him how long it had taken to write the book. He asked me if I was a writer, and I said that that remained to be seen. Then he answered my question: “Twelve years,” he said.Later that night, I told a friend about my strange phone call, and when I got to the bit about twelve years, I said, “You see, it’s hopeless.” But that wasn’t really what I felt, and I knew it. What I had felt when I hung up the phone was that I had got what I wanted. What I felt was: it was worth it.Johnson, who died this week, at the age of sixty-seven, started out as a poet, and had published his first book of verse when he was nineteen, then spent much of the next decade in the grip of fierce addictions. But once he started publishing again, he made a regular habit of it, producing new books—novels mostly, but also collections of stories and poems and magazine reportage—steadily for the rest of his life. He was an uneven writer, but even his most forgettable work throbbed with his irreducibly American voice, idiomatically vivid, veering between hardboiled banter and hyperacute physical and emotional immediacy—the banter often darkly comic, the description darkly ecstatic, observation so keen and compressed and so idiosyncratic that in bursts of just a few short sentences it could achieve a visionary quality.He liked to play off the edges of genre, spy thrillers, noir, even science fiction—as in his haunting second novel, “Fiskadoro,” which unfolds in a time after nuclear devastation in a place like the Florida Keys. But, whether Johnson was retreading the footsteps of Robert Stone and Graham Greene in the wreckage of Latin American or African revolutions, or of America’s war in Vietnam, or drifting like an unlaid ghost back and forth across the American home front, his fictions rode from book to book on the shoulders of an ever-growing cast of self-dramatizing miscreants—men of schemes and scams, in the grip of unwholesome appetites, brazen but rarely honorable, self-seeking but not self-aware, largely indifferent to cause and effect, defined chiefly by their derelictions and delusions, their missteps and misjudgments, possessed of a seemingly bottomless attraction to bad and violent situations and a limitless capacity for making them worse—in short, men roughly as entertaining on the page as they would surely be repellent in person.Johnson’s own fictional surrogate, the lowlife junky narrator of his most autobiographical and most popular book, “Jesus’ Son,” is named Fuckhead. “It’s a name that’s going to stick,” a fellow addict tells him. “ ‘Fuckhead’ is gonna ride you to your grave.” And it’s true. The name straddles the character like a slapstick fate. It tells you about Johnson, too: he’s harsh and he’s funny, and he’s always swinging between hardboiled and hallucinatory. Fuckhead, the self-poisoner, is a catastrophe, but an ecstatic catastrophe, at once blinded and visionary, spiritually craving and morally craven, a more or less totally hopeless misadventurer, except insofar as he’s not dead yet, which makes him prone to that wild kind of hope that another of Johnson’s antiheroes (a death-row prisoner in “Angels”) describes in the poem “Talking Richard Clay Wilson Blues, by Richard Clay Wilson”:I am not happy. Disappointmentlights its stupid fire in my heart,but two days a week I staffthe Max Security laundry above the worldon the seventh level, looking at two long roadsout there that go to a couple of towns.Young girls accelerating through the intersectionmake me want to live forever,they make me think of the grand things,of wars and extremely white, quiet light that never dies.Fuckhead says things like this: “The travelling salesman had fed me pills that made the linings of my veins feel scraped out. My jaw ached. I knew every raindrop by its name. I sensed everything before it happened.” This is in a story called “Car-Crash While Hitchhiking,” and when the crash happens, and he’s at the hospital with what’s left of the family whose car he was in, he says, “Down the hall came the wife. She was glorious, burning. She didn’t know yet that her husband was dead. We knew. That’s what gave her such power over us.” And when she learns that she’s a widow, what Fuckhead says is, “What a pair of lungs! She shrieked as I imagined an eagle would shriek. It felt wonderful to be alive to hear it! I’ve gone looking for that feeling everywhere.”Another time, he and his buddy Jack Hotel, who’s out on bail while standing trial for armed robbery, drink through the night, and when morning finds them they steal a Social Security check from a dead man’s mail, cash it, buy some heroin, split it, and go their separate ways. Fuckhead barely survives an overdose, but he’s not alarmed. No, he’s enraptured by the near miss: “I was overjoyed not to be dead. Generally the closest I ever came to wondering about the meaning of it all was to consider that I must be the victim of a joke. There was no touching the hem of mystery, no little occasion when any of us thought—well, speaking for myself only, I suppose—that our lungs were filled with light, or anything like that. I had a moment’s glory that night.” Meanwhile, across town, Hotel overdoses, too. Some friends of Fuckhead’s are there with him, and they watch over him—until they lose interest, and Hotel dies.Johnson said that “Jesus’ Son” was drawn from memory. “Almost everything in there actually happened to someone I know or heard about,” he told the Times. In his sober, hard-writing decades, he identified as a Christian, and questions of faith, usually in crisis, riddle his work. But it is impossible to detect any coherent sense of the writer’s religiosity from the fallen people in the fallen worlds of his books. What, I always wondered, did he believe in in his own life that was unavailable to his characters? I never had another conversation with Johnson after our phone call, so I never had occasion to ask.Fuckhead is not someone you’re supposed to respond to as good or bad or even in between in any conventional sense.

I dialled the number the operator gave me, a woman answered, and when I said his name, she asked who was calling, and I said, “A reader.”I had the impression, when I hung up the phone four or five minutes later, that he was wary at first, as if he could hear that I didn’t know what I wanted from him, and figured I must be a head case and he couldn’t get off the phone fast enough. Then, as he relaxed and became friendly, it occurred to me that he was right, I didn’t know what I wanted from him, and really must be a head case, and I couldn’t get off the phone fast enough. The only thing that he said that I remember exactly was when I asked him how long it had taken to write the book. He asked me if I was a writer, and I said that that remained to be seen. Then he answered my question: “Twelve years,” he said.Later that night, I told a friend about my strange phone call, and when I got to the bit about twelve years, I said, “You see, it’s hopeless.” But that wasn’t really what I felt, and I knew it. What I had felt when I hung up the phone was that I had got what I wanted. What I felt was: it was worth it.Johnson, who died this week, at the age of sixty-seven, started out as a poet, and had published his first book of verse when he was nineteen, then spent much of the next decade in the grip of fierce addictions. But once he started publishing again, he made a regular habit of it, producing new books—novels mostly, but also collections of stories and poems and magazine reportage—steadily for the rest of his life. He was an uneven writer, but even his most forgettable work throbbed with his irreducibly American voice, idiomatically vivid, veering between hardboiled banter and hyperacute physical and emotional immediacy—the banter often darkly comic, the description darkly ecstatic, observation so keen and compressed and so idiosyncratic that in bursts of just a few short sentences it could achieve a visionary quality.He liked to play off the edges of genre, spy thrillers, noir, even science fiction—as in his haunting second novel, “Fiskadoro,” which unfolds in a time after nuclear devastation in a place like the Florida Keys. But, whether Johnson was retreading the footsteps of Robert Stone and Graham Greene in the wreckage of Latin American or African revolutions, or of America’s war in Vietnam, or drifting like an unlaid ghost back and forth across the American home front, his fictions rode from book to book on the shoulders of an ever-growing cast of self-dramatizing miscreants—men of schemes and scams, in the grip of unwholesome appetites, brazen but rarely honorable, self-seeking but not self-aware, largely indifferent to cause and effect, defined chiefly by their derelictions and delusions, their missteps and misjudgments, possessed of a seemingly bottomless attraction to bad and violent situations and a limitless capacity for making them worse—in short, men roughly as entertaining on the page as they would surely be repellent in person.Johnson’s own fictional surrogate, the lowlife junky narrator of his most autobiographical and most popular book, “Jesus’ Son,” is named Fuckhead. “It’s a name that’s going to stick,” a fellow addict tells him. “ ‘Fuckhead’ is gonna ride you to your grave.” And it’s true. The name straddles the character like a slapstick fate. It tells you about Johnson, too: he’s harsh and he’s funny, and he’s always swinging between hardboiled and hallucinatory. Fuckhead, the self-poisoner, is a catastrophe, but an ecstatic catastrophe, at once blinded and visionary, spiritually craving and morally craven, a more or less totally hopeless misadventurer, except insofar as he’s not dead yet, which makes him prone to that wild kind of hope that another of Johnson’s antiheroes (a death-row prisoner in “Angels”) describes in the poem “Talking Richard Clay Wilson Blues, by Richard Clay Wilson”:I am not happy. Disappointmentlights its stupid fire in my heart,but two days a week I staffthe Max Security laundry above the worldon the seventh level, looking at two long roadsout there that go to a couple of towns.Young girls accelerating through the intersectionmake me want to live forever,they make me think of the grand things,of wars and extremely white, quiet light that never dies.Fuckhead says things like this: “The travelling salesman had fed me pills that made the linings of my veins feel scraped out. My jaw ached. I knew every raindrop by its name. I sensed everything before it happened.” This is in a story called “Car-Crash While Hitchhiking,” and when the crash happens, and he’s at the hospital with what’s left of the family whose car he was in, he says, “Down the hall came the wife. She was glorious, burning. She didn’t know yet that her husband was dead. We knew. That’s what gave her such power over us.” And when she learns that she’s a widow, what Fuckhead says is, “What a pair of lungs! She shrieked as I imagined an eagle would shriek. It felt wonderful to be alive to hear it! I’ve gone looking for that feeling everywhere.”Another time, he and his buddy Jack Hotel, who’s out on bail while standing trial for armed robbery, drink through the night, and when morning finds them they steal a Social Security check from a dead man’s mail, cash it, buy some heroin, split it, and go their separate ways. Fuckhead barely survives an overdose, but he’s not alarmed. No, he’s enraptured by the near miss: “I was overjoyed not to be dead. Generally the closest I ever came to wondering about the meaning of it all was to consider that I must be the victim of a joke. There was no touching the hem of mystery, no little occasion when any of us thought—well, speaking for myself only, I suppose—that our lungs were filled with light, or anything like that. I had a moment’s glory that night.” Meanwhile, across town, Hotel overdoses, too. Some friends of Fuckhead’s are there with him, and they watch over him—until they lose interest, and Hotel dies.Johnson said that “Jesus’ Son” was drawn from memory. “Almost everything in there actually happened to someone I know or heard about,” he told the Times. In his sober, hard-writing decades, he identified as a Christian, and questions of faith, usually in crisis, riddle his work. But it is impossible to detect any coherent sense of the writer’s religiosity from the fallen people in the fallen worlds of his books. What, I always wondered, did he believe in in his own life that was unavailable to his characters? I never had another conversation with Johnson after our phone call, so I never had occasion to ask.Fuckhead is not someone you’re supposed to respond to as good or bad or even in between in any conventional sense. He is the American expression of what the Russians call a holy fool, a fleshing out of William Carlos Williams’s declamation, “The pure products of America go crazy.” He’s someone you have to respond to the way you respond to the deepest, weirdest, truest voices of rock and roll: you don’t want to be him, or even—if you’re at least halfway sane—to be with him; you just want to hear him tell it, because when he does everything feels heightened.Philip Gourevitch has been a regular contributor to The New Yorker since 1995 and a staff writer since 1997.Read more »More:Denis JohnsonFictionPoetrypostscriptDive into the world of literature with The New Yorker’s weekly fiction newsletter.SubmitDenis Johnson’s work throbbed with his irreducibly American voice, idiomatically vivid, veering between hardboiled banter and hyperacute physical and emotional immediacy.PHOTOGRAPH BY ANTHONY MADDALONI / HARRY RANSOM CENTERDenis Johnson’s work throbbed with his irreducibly American voice, idiomatically vivid, veering between hardboiled banter and hyperacute physical and emotional immediacy.PHOTOGRAPH BY ANTHONY MADDALONI / HARRY RANSOM CENTERDenis Johnson’s work throbbed with his irreducibly American voice, idiomatically vivid, veering between hardboiled banter and hyperacute physical and emotional immediacy.PHOTOGRAPH BY ANTHONY MADDALONI / HARRY RANSOM CENTERDenis Johnson’s work throbbed with his irreducibly American voice, idiomatically vivid, veering between hardboiled banter and hyperacute physical and emotional immediacy.Denis Johnson’s first and most perfectly realized novel, “Angels,” was the first novel I ever bought new, in hardcover. This was in 1983, in Ithaca, New York, the first wet, yellow week of upstate October. I was twenty-one, a college dropout, working as a bartender in support of the claim that I was writing my own first novel. Some days, the writing didn’t happen. On that day in October, I gave up early, midmorning, and went wandering, and wound up in a bookstore, and there was “Angels,” in a display of début fiction. Its cover showed a charcoal-black desert landscape split by lightning, with the title in hot red type. It was a good-looking cover. How else can you judge a book that you haven’t read, much less heard of? I picked it up and started reading:In the Oakland Greyhound, all the people were dwarves, and they pushed and shoved to get on the bus, even cutting in ahead of the two nuns, who were there first. The two nuns smiled sweetly at Miranda and Baby Ellen and played I-see-you behind their fingers when they’d taken their seats. But Jamie could sense that they found her make-up too thick, her pants too tight. They knew she was leaving her husband, and figured she’d turn for a living to whoring.I flipped to the inside of the back cover and looked at the author: young guy, black curly hair, expression alive and engaged, kind of amused but far away, too, unaware of the camera, in another dimension. I kept reading. On the third page, there was a paragraph that went like this:She fed Baby Ellen her orange juice and watched the sun as it moved into prominence above the dead cornfields in Indiana, the light striking her face painfully as it ticked over the frozen pools and the rows of broken stalks glazed with ice. Her husband angrily sold stereophonic components for a living. He brooded on his life, and it grew on him until he was rattling around inside of it. Why couldn’t she just be thankful to him, he always wanted to know, since he was losing track of what he wanted just so she could have everything she wanted? Couldn’t she see how everything kept happening? It was just—he pounded his fist on the wall so the small trailer shook—one moment goes to the next . . . He choked her close to death twice, frantic to think she couldn’t understand his complaint. And she couldn’t.I read a few more pages, then bought the book and carried it home, to my chair, where I reëntered it and did not leave until I had finished it, six or seven hours of astonishing drama, and violence, and darkly dazzling, hyper-precise, and, at the same time, wailing prose later. Then I looked again at the author photo. Who was this guy? Who wrote this language that carried traces of many writers I’d read before but was its own world entirely?

But, whether Johnson was retreading the footsteps of Robert Stone and Graham Greene in the wreckage of Latin American or African revolutions, or of America’s war in Vietnam, or drifting like an unlaid ghost back and forth across the American home front, his fictions rode from book to book on the shoulders of an ever-growing cast of self-dramatizing miscreants—men of schemes and scams, in the grip of unwholesome appetites, brazen but rarely honorable, self-seeking but not self-aware, largely indifferent to cause and effect, defined chiefly by their derelictions and delusions, their missteps and misjudgments, possessed of a seemingly bottomless attraction to bad and violent situations and a limitless capacity for making them worse—in short, men roughly as entertaining on the page as they would surely be repellent in person.Johnson’s own fictional surrogate, the lowlife junky narrator of his most autobiographical and most popular book, “Jesus’ Son,” is named Fuckhead. “It’s a name that’s going to stick,” a fellow addict tells him. “ ‘Fuckhead’ is gonna ride you to your grave.” And it’s true. The name straddles the character like a slapstick fate. It tells you about Johnson, too: he’s harsh and he’s funny, and he’s always swinging between hardboiled and hallucinatory. Fuckhead, the self-poisoner, is a catastrophe, but an ecstatic catastrophe, at once blinded and visionary, spiritually craving and morally craven, a more or less totally hopeless misadventurer, except insofar as he’s not dead yet, which makes him prone to that wild kind of hope that another of Johnson’s antiheroes (a death-row prisoner in “Angels”) describes in the poem “Talking Richard Clay Wilson Blues, by Richard Clay Wilson”:I am not happy. Disappointmentlights its stupid fire in my heart,but two days a week I staffthe Max Security laundry above the worldon the seventh level, looking at two long roadsout there that go to a couple of towns.Young girls accelerating through the intersectionmake me want to live forever,they make me think of the grand things,of wars and extremely white, quiet light that never dies.Fuckhead says things like this: “The travelling salesman had fed me pills that made the linings of my veins feel scraped out. My jaw ached. I knew every raindrop by its name. I sensed everything before it happened.” This is in a story called “Car-Crash While Hitchhiking,” and when the crash happens, and he’s at the hospital with what’s left of the family whose car he was in, he says, “Down the hall came the wife. She was glorious, burning. She didn’t know yet that her husband was dead. We knew. That’s what gave her such power over us.” And when she learns that she’s a widow, what Fuckhead says is, “What a pair of lungs! She shrieked as I imagined an eagle would shriek. It felt wonderful to be alive to hear it! I’ve gone looking for that feeling everywhere.”Another time, he and his buddy Jack Hotel, who’s out on bail while standing trial for armed robbery, drink through the night, and when morning finds them they steal a Social Security check from a dead man’s mail, cash it, buy some heroin, split it, and go their separate ways. Fuckhead barely survives an overdose, but he’s not alarmed. No, he’s enraptured by the near miss: “I was overjoyed not to be dead. Generally the closest I ever came to wondering about the meaning of it all was to consider that I must be the victim of a joke. There was no touching the hem of mystery, no little occasion when any of us thought—well, speaking for myself only, I suppose—that our lungs were filled with light, or anything like that. I had a moment’s glory that night.” Meanwhile, across town, Hotel overdoses, too. Some friends of Fuckhead’s are there with him, and they watch over him—until they lose interest, and Hotel dies.Johnson said that “Jesus’ Son” was drawn from memory. “Almost everything in there actually happened to someone I know or heard about,” he told the Times. In his sober, hard-writing decades, he identified as a Christian, and questions of faith, usually in crisis, riddle his work. But it is impossible to detect any coherent sense of the writer’s religiosity from the fallen people in the fallen worlds of his books. What, I always wondered, did he believe in in his own life that was unavailable to his characters? I never had another conversation with Johnson after our phone call, so I never had occasion to ask.Fuckhead is not someone you’re supposed to respond to as good or bad or even in between in any conventional sense. He is the American expression of what the Russians call a holy fool, a fleshing out of William Carlos Williams’s declamation, “The pure products of America go crazy.” He’s someone you have to respond to the way you respond to the deepest, weirdest, truest voices of rock and roll: you don’t want to be him, or even—if you’re at least halfway sane—to be with him; you just want to hear him tell it, because when he does everything feels heightened.Denis Johnson’s first and most perfectly realized novel, “Angels,” was the first novel I ever bought new, in hardcover. This was in 1983, in Ithaca, New York, the first wet, yellow week of upstate October. I was twenty-one, a college dropout, working as a bartender in support of the claim that I was writing my own first novel. Some days, the writing didn’t happen. On that day in October, I gave up early, midmorning, and went wandering, and wound up in a bookstore, and there was “Angels,” in a display of début fiction. Its cover showed a charcoal-black desert landscape split by lightning, with the title in hot red type. It was a good-looking cover. How else can you judge a book that you haven’t read, much less heard of? I picked it up and started reading:In the Oakland Greyhound, all the people were dwarves, and they pushed and shoved to get on the bus, even cutting in ahead of the two nuns, who were there first. The two nuns smiled sweetly at Miranda and Baby Ellen and played I-see-you behind their fingers when they’d taken their seats. But Jamie could sense that they found her make-up too thick, her pants too tight. They knew she was leaving her husband, and figured she’d turn for a living to whoring.I flipped to the inside of the back cover and looked at the author: young guy, black curly hair, expression alive and engaged, kind of amused but far away, too, unaware of the camera, in another dimension. I kept reading. On the third page, there was a paragraph that went like this:She fed Baby Ellen her orange juice and watched the sun as it moved into prominence above the dead cornfields in Indiana, the light striking her face painfully as it ticked over the frozen pools and the rows of broken stalks glazed with ice. Her husband angrily sold stereophonic components for a living. He brooded on his life, and it grew on him until he was rattling around inside of it. Why couldn’t she just be thankful to him, he always wanted to know, since he was losing track of what he wanted just so she could have everything she wanted? Couldn’t she see how everything kept happening? It was just—he pounded his fist on the wall so the small trailer shook—one moment goes to the next . . . He choked her close to death twice, frantic to think she couldn’t understand his complaint. And she couldn’t.I read a few more pages, then bought the book and carried it home, to my chair, where I reëntered it and did not leave until I had finished it, six or seven hours of astonishing drama, and violence, and darkly dazzling, hyper-precise, and, at the same time, wailing prose later. Then I looked again at the author photo. Who was this guy? Who wrote this language that carried traces of many writers I’d read before but was its own world entirely? If this was his first book, he must want to hear how good it is. The bio beneath his photo said he lived on Cape Cod. I picked up the phone and called information. I dialled the number the operator gave me, a woman answered, and when I said his name, she asked who was calling, and I said, “A reader.”I had the impression, when I hung up the phone four or five minutes later, that he was wary at first, as if he could hear that I didn’t know what I wanted from him, and figured I must be a head case and he couldn’t get off the phone fast enough. Then, as he relaxed and became friendly, it occurred to me that he was right, I didn’t know what I wanted from him, and really must be a head case, and I couldn’t get off the phone fast enough. The only thing that he said that I remember exactly was when I asked him how long it had taken to write the book. He asked me if I was a writer, and I said that that remained to be seen. Then he answered my question: “Twelve years,” he said.Later that night, I told a friend about my strange phone call, and when I got to the bit about twelve years, I said, “You see, it’s hopeless.” But that wasn’t really what I felt, and I knew it. What I had felt when I hung up the phone was that I had got what I wanted. What I felt was: it was worth it.Johnson, who died this week, at the age of sixty-seven, started out as a poet, and had published his first book of verse when he was nineteen, then spent much of the next decade in the grip of fierce addictions. But once he started publishing again, he made a regular habit of it, producing new books—novels mostly, but also collections of stories and poems and magazine reportage—steadily for the rest of his life. He was an uneven writer, but even his most forgettable work throbbed with his irreducibly American voice, idiomatically vivid, veering between hardboiled banter and hyperacute physical and emotional immediacy—the banter often darkly comic, the description darkly ecstatic, observation so keen and compressed and so idiosyncratic that in bursts of just a few short sentences it could achieve a visionary quality.He liked to play off the edges of genre, spy thrillers, noir, even science fiction—as in his haunting second novel, “Fiskadoro,” which unfolds in a time after nuclear devastation in a place like the Florida Keys.
